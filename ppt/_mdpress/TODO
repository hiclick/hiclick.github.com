- make more stylesheets.
- refactor, code looks ugly right now.
- add tests?
- add online service to host presentations?
- change h1's to mean new slides (or see how documentup does it)
- add option to render html file only, not update styles etc.
- some way to update stylesheets without re-installing the gem?
- some way to add classes to slides? you can just do class='soandso' but that could be documented better
- add stylesheet gallery?
