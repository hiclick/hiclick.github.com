My name is [Chen Zixin](http://chenzixin.com)<sup><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>, I am a Chinese software engineer currently living in Dongcheng District of Beijing with my wifi and a cat.

When I was young, I wanted to be a lawyer. That was before I got a job as a game editor in [PConline](http://www.pconline.cn)<sup><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup> since early 2004. From then on, I seized the good opportunity to take part in web application design, and interact with programers. As time goes on, I knew I would be a developer. I never stopped writing code since May 25, 2007. Many thanks to Alan, Neil and Guitang Yang.

I still enjoy Chinese Ancient Culture and Hard Pen Calligraphic. It’s probably because I used to be a liberal art student in [Hust](http://www.hust.edu.cn)<small>&nbsp;</small><sup><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></sup>.
