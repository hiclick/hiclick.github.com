## Share of voice

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_of_voice)<sup><i class="fa fa-external-link fa-fw"></i></sup>

Share of Voice in Online Advertising is an ad revenue model that focuses on weight or percentage among other advertisers.
For example, if there are four advertisers on a website, each advertiser gets 25 percent of the advertising weight.
This method ensures one ad will not be seen any more than the other three ads. And, since there are typically a limited
number of advertisers using a Share of Voice model, ad exposure is optimized.

In other words, Share of Voice is used to "represent the relative portion of ad inventory available to a single
advertiser within a defined market over a specified time period."

Share of voice (SOV) essentially means comparing your crucial performance metrics against those of key competitors’.  Which
metrics are compared is up to the individual marketer and/or as preset in various SOV tools.  It’s best to start by
saying that share of voice means different things to different marketers.

## Impression Share

Are we alone in the universe? How much wood can a woodchuck chuck? What's the share of voice for my AdWords campaign?

While we're still working on answers to the first two questions, there's a new metric available through the AdWords
Report Center that will shed light on the third one.

"Share of voice" is a metric often used in the advertising industry to represent the relative portion of ad inventory
available to a single advertiser within a defined market over a specified time period. Impression Share, a new AdWords
metric, is similar to share of voice -- it represents the percentage of times your ads were actually shown in relation
to the total number of chances your ads could have been shown, based on your keyword and campaign settings.

For example, say you own a small lawn furniture business and you're using AdWords to sell your products. You're curious
to know if you're missing out on potential sales by not appearing every time users search on your keywords. To compare
how often your ads are showing to the total opportunities they have to show, run a campaign- or account-level performance
report that includes the new Impression Share columns.

Here’s a quick rundown of what each Impression Share column represents:

Impression Share (IS): The percentage of times your ads were shown out of the total available impressions in the market
you were targeting. This metric is available at the campaign and account level for search.

Lost IS (Rank): The percentage of impressions lost due to low Ad Rank (cost-per-click bid x Quality Score).

Lost IS (Budget): The percentage of impressions lost due to budget constraints.

Using our lawn furniture example, the Impression Share results in the above report may be within your expectations given you:

* are small business,
* target your ads to one state (e.g. Arizona), and
* use ad scheduling so your ads only show on the weekdays when your store is open.

The above conditions help establish your ads' total opportunities to show. Any opportunities to show outside of Arizona
or on the weekends do not count against your Impression Share since Impression Share is only measured against the
opportunities you're interested in. In contrast, if you targeted more states or scheduled your ads to appear over the
weekend, you might see your Impression Share percentage decrease since your ads would have many more opportunities to show.

Not every advertiser's goal is to appear each time his or her ads have the opportunity to show; however, Impression Share
is a convenient way to assess shifts in the competitive landscape as well as ways to diagnose where you're losing Impression Share.

Impression Share is available for performance reports at the account- or campaign-level and you can find instructions on
how to include the metric in your next report here.

**Google AdWords adds share-of-voice metric**

Google has added another metric which will give pay-per-click advertisers more insight in to how their campaigns are performing.

by Helen Leggatt

Google AdWords advertisers now have access to additional reports via the “AdWords Report Center”. The new feature,
called “Impression Share”, is similar to “share of voice”. In simple terms it allows an advertiser to compare the
percentage of times their ads were displayed with the number of opportunities there were for those ads to be displayed.

There are several ways in which this information can be used by online advertisers to improve upon campaign performance.
Knowing that an ad is being diplayed on only a small percentage of the potential times it could have been shown can lead to
useful testing of keywords, timings, budget levels and conversion levels to see whether increasing “impression share”
has a positive affect on ROI.

Of course, increasing “impression share” may be not the solution if additional impressions, and consequently budget
spend, have no effect on conversion rates and advertisers might want to consider revisiting keywords and landing pages.

“Not every advertiser's goal is to appear each time his or her ads have the opportunity to show; however, Impression
Share is a convenient way to assess shifts in the competitive landscape as well as ways to diagnose where you're losing Impression Share,” according to the Inside AdWords blog.

Search engine giant Google has released another enhancement to its AdWords advertising platform which will allow advertisers
to get a better understanding of their campaigns’ performance. The new impression metrics are akin to traditional
advertising’s “Share of Voice” measurements.

As detailed in the Inside AdWords blog, “Share of voice” is a metric often used in the advertising industry to represent
the relative portion of ad inventory available to a single advertiser within a defined market over a specified time period.

So if you’re a Google AdWords advertiser, the Impression Metrics let you know how many times your ads were displayed
relative to the total number of ad views across the Google network based on your keywords and campaign settings.
