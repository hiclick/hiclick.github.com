# Google - reCAPTCHA

https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/

The FREE anti-abuse service.

Easy to add, advanced security, accessible to wide range of users and platforms.

reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects your site from spam and abuse. It uses advanced risk analysis engine to tell
humans and bots apart. With the new API, a significant number of your valid human users will pass the reCAPTCHA challenge
without having to solve a CAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA comes in the form of a widget that you can easily add to your blog, forum,
registration form, etc.

Hundreds of millions of CAPTCHAs are solved by people every day. reCAPTCHA makes positive use of this human effort by
channeling the time spent solving CAPTCHAs into digitizing text, annotating images, building machine learning datasets.
This in turn helps preserve books, improve maps, and solve hard AI problems.
