# Google - Public DNS


https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/


Google Public DNS is a free, global Domain Name System (DNS) resolution service, that you can use as an alternative to
your current DNS provider.

To try it out:

Configure your network settings to use the IP addresses 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 as your DNS servers:

* 8.8.8.8
* 8.8.4.4
