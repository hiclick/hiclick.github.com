SHE RETURNED WITHOUT purpose, merely because she could not stay in her country house longer than three days after her last visit to the quarry. She had to be in the city; it was a sudden necessity, irresistible and senseless. She expected nothing of the city. But she wanted the feeling of the streets and the buildings holding her there. In the morning, when she awakened and heard the muffled roar of traffic far below, the sound was a humiliation, a reminder of where she was and why. She stood at the window, her arms spread wide, holding on to each side of the frame; it was as if she held a piece of the city, all the streets and rooftops outlined on the glass between her two hands.</p><p class="calibre_10">She went out alone for long walks. She walked fast, her hands in the pockets of an old coat, its collar raised. She had told herself that she was not hoping to meet him. She was not looking for him. But she had to be out in the streets, blank, purposeless, for hours at a time.</p><p class="calibre_10">She had always hated the streets of a city. She saw the faces streaming past her, the faces made alike by fear—fear as a common denominator, fear of themselves, fear of all and of one another, fear making them ready to pounce upon whatever was held sacred by any single one they met. She could not define the nature or the reason of that fear. But she had always felt its presence. She had kept herself clean and free in a single passion—to touch nothing. She had liked facing them in the streets, she had liked the impotence of their hatred, because she offered them nothing to be hurt.</p><p class="calibre_10">She was not free any longer. Each step through the streets hurt her now. She was tied to him—and he was tied to every part of the city. He was a nameless worker doing some nameless job, lost in these crowds, dependent on them, to be hurt by any one of them, to be shared by her with the whole city. She hated the thought of him on the sidewalks people had used. She hated the thought of a clerk handing to him a package of cigarettes across a counter. She hated the elbows touching his elbows in a subway train. She came home, after these walks, shaking with fever. She went out again the next day.</p><p class="calibre_10">When the term of her vacation expired, she went to the office of the Banner in order to resign. Her work and her column did not seem amusing to her any longer. She stopped Alvah Scarret’s effusive greetings. She said: “I just came back to tell you that I’m quitting, Alvah.” He looked at her stupidly. He uttered only: “Why?”</p><p class="calibre_10">It was the first sound from the outside world to reach her in a long time. She had always acted on the impulse of the moment, proud of the freedom to need no reasons for her actions. Now she had to face a “why?” that carried an answer she could not escape. She thought: Because of him, because she was letting him change the course of her life. It would be another violation; she could see him smiling as he had smiled on the path in the woods. She had no choice. Either course taken would be taken under compulsion: she could leave her work, because he had made her want to leave it, or she could remain, hating it, in order to keep her life unchanged, in defiance of him. The last was harder.</p><p class="calibre_10">She raised her head. She said: “Just a joke, Alvah. Just wanted to see what you’d say. I’m not quitting.”</p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_10">She had been back at work for a few days when Ellsworth Toohey walked into her office.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Hello, Dominique,” he said. “Just heard you’re back.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Hello, Ellsworth.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’m glad. You know, I’ve always had the feeling that you’ll walk out on us some morning without any reason.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“The feeling, Ellsworth? Or the hope?”</p><p class="calibre_10">He was looking at her, his eyes as kindly, his smile as charming as ever; but there was a tinge of self-mockery in the charm, as if he knew that she did not approve of it, and a tinge of assurance, as if he were showing that he would look kindly and charming just the same.</p><p class="calibre_10">“You know, you’re wrong there,” he said, smiling peacefully. “You’ve always been wrong about that.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No. I don’t fit, Ellsworth. Do I?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I could, of course, ask: Into what? But supposing I don’t ask it. Supposing I just say that people who don’t fit have their uses also, as well as those who do? Would you like that better? Of course, the simplest thing to say is that I’ve always been a great admirer of yours and always will be.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“That’s not a compliment.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Somehow, I don’t think we’ll ever be enemies, Dominique, if that’s what you’d like.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, I don’t think we’ll ever be enemies, Ellsworth. You’re the most comforting person I know.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Of course.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“In the sense I mean?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“In any sense you wish.”</p><p class="calibre_10">On the desk before her lay the rotogravure section of the Sunday <span class="italic">Chronicle.</span> It was folded on the page that bore the drawing of the Enright House. She picked it up and held it out to him, her eyes narrowed in a silent question. He looked at the drawing, then his glance moved to her face and returned to the drawing. He let the paper drop back on the desk.</p><p class="calibre_10">“As independent as an insult, isn’t it?” he said.</p><p class="calibre_10">“You know, Ellsworth, I think the man who designed this should have committed suicide. A man who can conceive a thing as beautiful as this should never allow it to be erected. He should not want it to exist. But he will let it be built, so that women will hang diapers on his terraces, so that men will spit on his stairways and draw dirty pictures on his walls. He’s given it to them and he’s made it part of them, part of everything. He shouldn’t have offered it for men like you to look at. For men like you to talk about. He’s defiled his own work by the first word you’ll utter about it. He’s made himself worse than you are. You’ll be committing only a mean little indecency, but he’s committed a sacrilege. A man who knows what he must have known to produce this should not have been able to remain alive.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Going to write a piece about this?” he asked.</p><p class="calibre_10">“No. That would be repeating his crime.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“And talking to me about it?”</p><p class="calibre_10">She looked at him. He was smiling pleasantly.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes of course,” she said, “that’s part of the same crime also.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Let’s have dinner together one of these days, Dominique,” he said. “You really don’t let me see enough of you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“All right,” she said. “Any time you wish.”</p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_10">At his trial for the assault on Ellsworth Toohey, Steven Mallory refused to disclose his motive. He made no statement. He seemed indifferent to any possible sentence. But Ellsworth Toohey created a minor sensation when he appeared, unsolicited, in Mallory’s defense. He pleaded with the judge for leniency; he explained that he had no desire to see Mallory’s future and career destroyed. Everybody in the courtroom was touched—except Steven Mallory. Steven Mallory listened and looked as if he were enduring some special process of cruelty. The judge gave him two years and suspended the sentence.</p><p class="calibre_10">There was a great deal of comment on Toohey’s extraordinary generosity. Toohey dismissed all praise, gaily and modestly. “My friends,” was his remark—the one to appear in all the papers—“I refuse to be an accomplice in the manufacturing of martyrs.”</p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_10">At the first meeting of the proposed organization of young architects Keating concluded that Toohey had a wonderful ability for choosing people who fitted well together. There was an air about the eighteen persons present which he could not define, but which gave him a sense of comfort, a security he had not experienced in solitude or in any other gathering; and part of the comfort was the knowledge that all the others felt the same way for the same unaccountable reason. It was a feeling of brotherhood, but somehow not of a sainted or noble brotherhood; yet this precisely was the comfort—that one felt, among them, no necessity for being sainted or noble.</p><p class="calibre_10">Were it not for this kinship, Keating would have been disappointed in the gathering. Of the eighteen seated about Toohey’s living room, none was an architect of distinction, except himself and Gordon L. Prescott, who wore a beige turtle-neck sweater and looked faintly patronizing, but eager. Keating had never heard the names of the others. Most of them were beginners, young, poorly dressed and belligerent. Some were only draftsmen. There was one woman architect who had built a few small private homes, mainly for wealthy widows; she had an aggressive manner, a tight mouth and a fresh petunia in her hair. There was a boy with pure, innocent eyes. There was an obscure contractor with a fat, expressionless face. There was a tall, dry woman who was an interior decorator, and another woman of no definite occupation at all.</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating could not understand what exactly was to be the purpose of the group, though there was a great deal of talk. None of the talk was too coherent, but all of it seemed to have the same undercurrent. He felt that the undercurrent was the one thing clear among all the vague generalities, even though nobody would mention it. It held him there, as it held the others, and he had no desire to define it.</p><p class="calibre_10">The young men talked a great deal about injustice, unfairness, the cruelty of society toward youth, and suggested that everyone should have his future commissions guaranteed when he left college. The woman architect shrieked briefly something about the iniquity of the rich. The contractor barked that it was a hard world and that “fellows gotta help one another.” The boy with the innocent eyes pleaded that “we could do so much good ...” His voice had a note of desperate sincerity which seemed embarrassing and out of place. Gordon L. Prescott declared that the A.G.A. was a bunch of old fogies with no conception of social responsibility and not a drop of virile blood in the lot of them, and that it was time to kick them in the pants anyway. The woman of indefinite occupation spoke about ideals and causes, though nobody could gather just what these were.</p><p class="calibre_10">Peter Keating was elected chairman, unanimously. Gordon L. Prescott was elected vice-chairman and treasurer. Toohey declined all nominations. He declared that he would act only as an unofficial advisor. It was decided that the organization would be named the “Council of American Builders.” It was decided that membership would not be restricted to architects, but would be open to “allied crafts” and to “all those holding the interests of the great profession of building at heart.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Then Toohey spoke. He spoke at some length, standing up, leaning on the knuckles of one hand against a table. His great voice was soft and persuasive. It filled the room, but it made his listeners realize that it could have filled a Roman amphitheater; there was something subtly flattering in this realization, in the sound of the powerful voice being held in check for their benefit.</p><p class="calibre_10">“... and thus, my friends, what the architectural profession lacks is an understanding of its own social importance. This lack is due to a double cause: to the anti-social nature of our entire society and to your own inherent modesty. You have been conditioned to think of yourselves merely as breadwinners with no higher purpose than to earn your fees and the means of your own existence. Isn’t it time, my friends, to pause and to redefine your position in society? Of all the crafts, yours is the most important. Important, not in the amount of money you might make, not in the degree of artistic skill you might exhibit, but in the service you render to your fellow men. You are those who provide mankind’s shelter. Remember this and then look at our cities, at our slums, to realize the gigantic task awaiting you. But to meet this challenge you must be armed with a broader vision of yourselves and of your work. You are not hired lackeys of the rich. You are crusaders in the cause of the underprivileged and the unsheltered. Not by what we are shall we be judged, but by those we serve. Let us stand united in this spirit. Let us—in all matters—be faithful to this new, broader, higher perspective. Let us organize—well, my friends, shall I say—a nobler dream?”</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating listened avidly. He had always thought of himself as a bread-winner bent upon earning his fees, in a profession he had chosen because his mother had wanted him to choose it. It was gratifying to discover that he was much more than this; that his daily activity carried a nobler significance. It was pleasant and it was drugging. He knew that all the others in the room felt it also.</p><p class="calibre_10">“... and when our system of society collapses, the craft of builders will not be swept under, it will be swept up to greater prominence and greater recognition ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">The doorbell rang. Then Toohey’s valet appeared for an instant, holding the door of the living room open to admit Dominique Francon.</p><p class="calibre_10">By the manner in which Toohey stopped, on a half-uttered word, Keating knew that Dominique had not been invited or expected. She smiled at Toohey, shook her head and moved one hand in a gesture telling him to continue. He managed a faint bow in her direction, barely more than a movement of his eyebrows, and went on with his speech. It was a pleasant greeting and its informality included the guest in the intimate brotherhood of the occasion, but it seemed to Keating that it had come just one beat too late. He had never before seen Toohey miss the right moment.</p><p class="calibre_10">Dominique sat down in a corner, behind the others. Keating forgot to listen for a while, trying to attract her attention. He had to wait until her eyes had traveled thoughtfully about the room, from face to face, and stopped on his. He bowed and nodded vigorously, with the smile of greeting a private possession. She inclined her head, he saw her lashes touching her cheeks for an instant as her eyes closed, and then she looked at him again. She sat looking at him for a long moment, without smiling, as if she were rediscovering something in his face. He had not seen her since spring. He thought that she looked a little tired and lovelier than his memory of her.</p><p class="calibre_10">Then he turned to Ellsworth Toohey once more and he listened. The words he heard were as stirring as ever, but his pleasure in them had an edge of uneasiness. He looked at Dominique. She did not belong in this room, at this meeting. He could not say why, but the certainty of it was enormous and oppressive. It was not her beauty, it was not her insolent elegance. But something made her an outsider. It was as if they had all been comfortably naked, and a person had entered fully clothed, suddenly making them self-conscious and indecent. Yet she did nothing. She sat listening attentively. Once, she leaned back, crossing her legs, and lighted a cigarette. She shook the flame off the match with a brusque little jerk of her wrist and she dropped the match into an ash tray on a table beside her. He saw her drop the match into the ash tray; he felt as if that movement of her wrist had tossed the match into all their faces. He thought that he was being preposterous. But he noticed that Ellsworth Toohey never looked at her as he spoke.</p><p class="calibre_10">When the meeting ended, Toohey rushed over to her.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Dominique, my dear!” he said brightly. “Shall I consider myself flattered?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“If you wish.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Had I known that you were interested, I would have sent you a very special invitation.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“But you didn’t think I’d be interested?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, frankly, I ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">“That was a mistake, Ellsworth. You discounted my newspaper-woman’s instinct. Never miss a scoop. It’s not often that one has the chance to witness the birth of a felony.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Just exactly what do you mean, Dominique?” asked Keating, his voice sharp.</p><p class="calibre_10">She turned to him. “Hello, Peter.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You know Peter Keating of course?” Toohey smiled at her.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Oh, yes. Peter was in love with me once.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You’re using the wrong tense, Dominique,” said Keating.</p><p class="calibre_10">“You must never take seriously anything Dominique chooses to say, Peter. She does not intend us to take it seriously. Would you like to join our little group, Dominique? Your professional qualifications make you eminently eligible.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, Ellsworth. I wouldn’t like to join your little group. I really don’t hate you enough to do that.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Just why do you disapprove of it?” snapped Keating.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Why, Peter!” she drawled. “Whatever gave you that idea? I don’t disapprove of it at all. Do I, Ellsworth? I think it’s a proper undertaking in answer to an obvious necessity. It’s just what we all need—and deserve.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Can we count on your presence at our next meeting?” Toohey asked. “It is pleasant to have so understanding a listener who will not be in the way at alt—at our next meeting, I mean.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, Ellsworth. Thank you. It was merely curiosity. Though you do have an interesting group of people here. Young builders. By the way, why didn’t you invite that man who designed the Enright House—what’s his name?—Howard Roark?”</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating felt his jaw snap tight. But she looked at them innocently, she had said it lightly, in the tone of a casual remark—surely, he thought, she did not mean ... what? he asked himself and added: she did not mean whatever it was he’d thought for a moment she meant, whatever had terrified him in that moment.</p><p class="calibre_10">“I have never had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Roark,” Toohey answered gravely.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Do you know him?” Keating asked her.</p><p class="calibre_10">“No,” she answered. “I’ve merely seen a sketch of the Enright House.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“And?” Keating insisted. “What do you think of it?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t think of it,” she answered.</p><p class="calibre_10">When she turned to leave, Keating accompanied her. He looked at her in the elevator, on their way down. He saw her hand, in a tight black glove, holding the flat corner of a pocketbook. The limp carelessness of her fingers was insolent and inviting at once. He felt himself surrendering to her again.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Dominique, why did you actually come here today?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Oh, I haven’t been anywhere for a long time and I decided to start in with that. You know, when I go swimming I don’t like to torture myself getting into cold water by degrees. I dive right in and it’s a nasty shock, but after that the rest is not so hard to take.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“What do you mean? What do you really see that’s so wrong with that meeting? After all, we’re not planning to do anything definite. We don’t have any actual program. I don’t even know what we were there for.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“That’s it, Peter. You don’t even know what you were there for.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“It’s only a group for fellows to get together. Mostly to talk. What harm is there in that?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Peter, I’m tired.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Well, did your appearance tonight mean at least that you’re coming out of your seclusion?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes. Just that ... My seclusion?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’ve tried and tried to get in touch with you, you know.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Have you?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Shall I begin to tell you how happy I am to see you again?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No. Let’s consider that you’ve told me.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You know, you’ve changed, Dominique. I don’t know exactly in what way, but you’ve changed.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Have I?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Let’s consider that I’ve told you how lovely you are, because I can’t find words to say it.”</p><p class="calibre_10">The streets were dark. He called a cab. Sitting close to her, he turned and looked at her directly, his glance compelling like an open hint, hoping to make the silence significant between them. She did not turn away. She sat studying his face. She seemed to be wondering, attentive to some thought of her own which he could not guess. He reached over slowly and took her hand. He felt an effort in her hand, he could feel through her rigid fingers the effort of her whole arm, not an effort to withdraw her hand, but to let him hold it. He raised the hand, turned it over and pressed his lips to her wrist.</p><p class="calibre_10">Then he looked at her face. He dropped her hand and it remained suspended in the air for an instant, the fingers stiff, half closed. This was not the indifference he remembered. This was revulsion, so great that it became impersonal, it could not offend him, it seemed to include more than his person. He was suddenly aware of her body; not in desire or resentment, but just aware of its presence close to him, under her dress. He whispered involuntarily:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Dominique, who was he?”</p><p class="calibre_10">She whirled to face him. Then he saw her eyes narrowing. He saw her lips relaxing, growing fuller, softer, her mouth lengthening slowly into a faint smile, without opening. She answered, looking straight at him:</p><p class="calibre_10">“A workman in the granite quarry.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She succeeded; he laughed aloud.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Serves me right, Dominique. I shouldn’t suspect the impossible.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Peter, isn’t it strange? It was you that I thought I could make myself want, at one time.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Why is that strange?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Only in thinking how little we know about ourselves. Some day you’ll know the truth about yourself too, Peter, and it will be worse for you than for most of us. But you don’t have to think about it. It won’t come for a long time.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You did want me, Dominique?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I thought I could never want anything and you suited that so well.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t know what you mean. I don’t know what you ever think you’re saying. I know that I’ll always love you. And I won’t let you disappear again. Now that you’re back ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Now that I’m back, Peter, I don’t want to see you again. Oh, I’ll have to see you when we run into each other, as we will, but don’t call on me. Don’t come to see me. I’m not trying to offend you, Peter. It’s not that. You’ve done nothing to make me angry. It’s something in myself that I don’t want to face again. I’m sorry to choose you as the example. But you suit so well. You—Peter, you’re everything I despise in the world and I don’t want to remember how much I despise it. If I let myself remember—I’ll return to it. This is not an insult to you, Peter. Try to understand that. You’re not the worst of the world. You’re its best. That’s what’s frightening. If I ever come back to you—don’t let me come. I’m saying this now because I can, but if I come back to you, you won’t be able to stop me, and now is the only time when I can warn you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t know,” he said in cold fury, his lips stiff, “what you’re talking about.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Don’t try to know. It doesn’t matter. Let’s just stay away from each other. Shall we?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’ll never give you up.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She shrugged. “All right, Peter. This is the only time I’ve ever been kind to you. Or to anyone.”</p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_29"></div>
