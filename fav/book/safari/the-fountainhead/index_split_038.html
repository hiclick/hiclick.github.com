Dominique, how come?” In his anger, apprehension, curiosity and flattered pleasure, his first conscious thought was gratitude to God that his mother was not at home.</p><p class="calibre_10">“I phoned your office. They said you had gone home.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’m so delighted, so pleasantly sur ... Oh, hell, Dominique, what’s the use? I always try to be correct with you and you always see through it so well that it’s perfectly pointless. So I won’t play the poised host. You know that I’m knocked silly and that your coming here isn’t natural and anything I say will probably be wrong.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes, that’s better, Peter.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He noticed that he still held a key in his hand and he slipped it into his pocket; he had been packing a suitcase for his wedding trip of tomorrow. He glanced at the room and noted angrily how vulgar his Victorian furniture looked beside the elegance of Dominique’s figure. She wore a gray suit, a black fur jacket with a collar raised to her cheeks, and a hat slanting down. She did not look as she had looked on the witness stand, nor as he remembered her at dinner parties. He thought suddenly of that moment, years ago, when he stood on the stair landing outside Guy Francon’s office and wished never to see Dominique again. She was what she had been then: a stranger who frightened him by the crystal emptiness of her face.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Well, sit down, Dominique. Take your coat off.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, I shan’t stay long. Since we’re not pretending anything today, shall I tell you what I came for—or do you want some polite conversation first?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, I don’t want polite conversation.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“All right. Will you marry me, Peter?”</p><p class="calibre_10">He stood very still; then he sat down heavily—because he knew she meant it.</p><p class="calibre_10">“If you want to marry me,” she went on in the same precise, impersonal voice, “you must do it right now. My car is downstairs. We drive to Connecticut and we come back. It will take about three hours.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Dominique ...” He didn’t want to move his lips beyond the effort of her name. He wanted to think that he was paralyzed. He knew that he was violently alive, that he was forcing the stupor into his muscles and into his mind, because he wished to escape the responsibility of consciousness.</p><p class="calibre_10">“We’re not pretending, Peter. Usually, people discuss their reasons and their feelings first, then make the practical arrangements. With us, this is the only way. If I offered it to you in any other form, I’d be cheating you. It must be like this. No questions, no conditions, no explanations. What we don’t say answers itself. By not being said. There is nothing for you to ponder—only whether you want to do it or not.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Dominique,” he spoke with the concentration he used when he walked down a naked girder in an unfinished building, “I understand only this much: I understand that I must try to imitate you, not to discuss it, not to talk, just answer.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Only—I can’t—quite.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“This is one time, Peter, when there are no protections. Nothing to hide behind. Not even words.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“If you’d just say one thing ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“If you’d give me time ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No. Either we go downstairs together now or we forget it.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You mustn’t resent it if I ... You’ve never allowed me to hope that you could ... that you ... no, no, I won’t say it ... but what can you expect me to think? I’m here, alone, and ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">“And I’m the only one present to give you advice. My advice is to refuse. I’m honest with you, Peter. But I won’t help you by withdrawing the offer. You would prefer not to have had the chance of marrying me. But you have the chance. Now. The choice will be yours.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Then he could not hold on to his dignity any longer; he let his head drop, he pressed his fist to his forehead.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Dominique—<span class="italic">Why?</span>”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You know the reasons. I told them to you once, long ago. If you haven’t the courage to think of them, don’t expect me to repeat them.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He sat still, his head down. Then he said:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Dominique, two people like you and me getting married, it’s almost a front-page event.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Wouldn’t it be better to do it properly, with an announcement and a real wedding ceremony?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’m strong, Peter, but I’m not that strong. You can have your receptions and your publicity afterward.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You don’t want me to say anything now, except yes or no?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“That’s all.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He sat looking up at her for a long time. Her glance was on his eyes, but it had no more reality than the glance of a portrait. He felt alone in the room. She stood, patient, waiting, granting him nothing, not even the kindness of prompting him to hurry.</p><p class="calibre_10">“All right, Dominique. Yes,” he said at last.</p><p class="calibre_10">She inclined her head gravely in acquiescence.</p><p class="calibre_10">He stood up. “I’ll get my coat,” he said. “Do you want to take your car?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“It’s an open car, isn’t it? Should I wear my fur coat?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No. Take a warm muffler, though. There’s a little wind.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No luggage? We’re coming right back to the city?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“We’re coming right back.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He left the door to the hall open, and she saw him putting on his coat, throwing a muffler around his throat, with the gesture of flinging a cape over his shoulder. He stepped to the door of the living room, hat in hand, and invited her to go, with a silent movement of his head. In the hall outside he pressed the button of the elevator and he stepped back to let her enter first. He was precise, sure of himself, without joy, without emotion. He seemed more coldly masculine than he had ever been before.</p><p class="calibre_10">He took her elbow firmly, protectively, to cross the street where she had left her car. He opened the car’s door, let her slide behind the wheel and got in silently beside her. She leaned over across him and adjusted the glass wind screen on his side. She said: “If it’s not right, fix it any way you want when we start moving, so it won’t be too cold for you.” He said: “Get to the Grand Concourse, fewer lights there.” She put her handbag down on his lap while she took the wheel and started the car. There was suddenly no antagonism between them, but a quiet, hopeless feeling of comradeship, as if they were victims of the same impersonal disaster, who had to help each other.</p><p class="calibre_10">She drove fast, as a matter of habit, an even speed without a sense of haste. They sat silently to the level drone of the motor, and they sat patiently, without shifting the positions of their bodies, when the car stopped for a light. They seemed caught in a single streak of motion, an imperative direction like the flight of a bullet that could not be stopped on its course. There was a first hint of twilight in the streets of the city. The pavements looked yellow. The shops were still open. A movie theater had lighted its sign, and the red bulbs whirled jerkily, sucking the last daylight out of the air, making the street look darker.</p><p class="calibre_10">Peter Keating felt no need of speech. He did not seem to be Peter Keating any longer. He did not ask for warmth and he did not ask for pity. He asked nothing. She thought of that once, and she glanced at him, a glance of appreciation that was almost gentle. He met her eyes steadily; she saw understanding, but no comment. It was as if his glance said: “Of course,” nothing else.</p><p class="calibre_10">They were out of the city, with a cold brown road flying to meet them, when he said:</p><p class="calibre_10">“The traffic cops are bad around here. Got your press card with you, just in case?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’m not the press any longer.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You’re not what?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’m not a newspaper woman any more.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You quit your job?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, I was fired.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“What are you talking about?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Where have you been the last few days? I thought everybody knew it. ”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Sorry. I didn’t follow things very well the last few days.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Miles later, she said: “Give me a cigarette. In my bag.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He opened her bag, and he saw her cigarette case, her compact, her lipstick, her comb, a folded handkerchief too white to touch, smelling faintly of her perfume. Somewhere within him he thought that this was almost like unbuttoning her blouse. But most of him was not conscious of the thought nor of the intimate proprietorship with which he opened the bag. He took a cigarette from her case, lighted it and put it from his lips to hers. “Thanks,” she said. He lighted one for himself and closed the bag.</p><p class="calibre_10">When they reached Greenwich, it was he who made the inquiries, told her where to drive, at what block to turn, and said, “Here it is,” when they pulled up in front of the judge’s house. He got out first and helped her out of the car. He pressed the button of the doorbell.</p><p class="calibre_10">They were married in a living room that displayed armchairs of faded tapestry, blue and purple, and a lamp with a fringe of glass beads. The witnesses were the judge’s wife and someone from next door named Chuck, who had been interrupted at some household task and smelled faintly of Clorox.</p><p class="calibre_10">Then they came back to their car and Keating asked: “Want me to drive if you’re tired?” She said: “No, I’ll drive.”</p><p class="calibre_10">The road to the city cut through brown fields where every rise in the ground had a shade of tired red on the side facing west. There was a purple haze eating away the edges of the fields, and a motionless streak of fire in the sky. A few cars came toward them as brown shapes, still visible; others had their lights on, two disquieting spots of yellow.</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating watched the road; it looked narrow, a small dash in the middle of the windshield, framed by earth and hills, all of it held within the rectangle of glass before him. But the road spread as the windshield flew forward. The road filled the glass, it ran over the edges, it tore apart to let them pass, streaming in two gray bands on either side of the car. He thought it was a race and he waited to see the windshield win, to see the car hurtle into that small dash before it had time to stretch.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Where are we going to live now, at first?” he asked. “Your place or mine?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yours, of course.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’d rather move to yours.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No. I’m closing my place.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You can’t possibly like my apartment.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Why not?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t know. It doesn’t fit you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’ll like it.”</p><p class="calibre_10">They were silent for a while, then he asked: “How are we going to announce this now?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“In any way you wish. I’ll leave it up to you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">It was growing darker and she switched on the car’s headlights. He watched the small blurs of traffic signs, low by the side of the road, springing suddenly into life as they approached, spelling out: “Left turn,” “Crossing ahead,” in dots of light that seemed conscious, malevolent, winking.</p><p class="calibre_10">They drove silently, but there was no bond in their silence now; they were not walking together toward disaster; the disaster had come; their courage did not matter any longer. He felt disturbed and uncertain as he always felt in the presence of Dominique Francon.</p><p class="calibre_10">He half turned to look at her. She kept her eyes on the road. Her profile in the cold wind was serene and remote and lovely in a way that was hard to bear. He looked at her gloved hands resting firmly, one on each side of the wheel. He looked down at her slender foot on the accelerator, then his eyes rose up the line of her leg. His glance remained on the narrow triangle of her tight gray skirt. He realized suddenly that he had a right to think what he was thinking.</p><p class="calibre_10">For the first time this implication of marriage occurred to him fully and consciously. Then he knew that he had always wanted this woman, that it was the kind of feeling he would have for a whore, only lasting and hopeless and vicious. My wife, he thought for the first time, without a trace of respect in the word. He felt so violent a desire that had it been summer he would have ordered her to drive into the first side lane and he would have taken her there.</p><p class="calibre_10">He slipped his arm along the back of the seat and encircled her shoulders, his fingers barely touching her. She did not move, resist or turn to look at him. He pulled his arm away, and he sat staring straight ahead.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Mrs. Keating,” he said flatly, not addressing her, just as a statement of fact.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Mrs. Peter Keating,” she said.</p><p class="calibre_10">When they stopped in front of his apartment house, he got out and held the door for her, but she remained sitting behind the wheel.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Good night, Peter,” she said. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She added, before the expression of his face had turned into an obscene swearword: “I’ll send my things over tomorrow and we’ll discuss everything then. Everything will begin tomorrow, Peter.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Where are you going?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I have things to settle.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“But what will I tell people tonight?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Anything you wish, if at all.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She swung the car into the traffic and drove away.</p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_10">When she entered Roark’s room, that evening, he smiled, not his usual faint smile of acknowledging the expected, but a smile that spoke of waiting and pain.</p><p class="calibre_10">He had not seen her since the trial. She had left the courtroom after her testimony and he had heard nothing from her since. He had come to her house, but her maid had told him that Miss Francon could not see him.</p><p class="calibre_10">She looked at him now and she smiled. It was, for the first time, like a gesture of complete acceptance, as if the sight of him solved everything, answered all questions, and her meaning was only to be a woman who looked at him.</p><p class="calibre_10">They stood silently before each other for a moment, and she thought that the most beautiful words were those which were not needed.</p><p class="calibre_10">When he moved, she said: “Don’t say anything about the trial. Afterward.”</p><p class="calibre_10">When he took her in his arms, she turned her body to meet his straight on, to feel the width of his chest with the width of hers, the length of his legs with the length of hers, as if she were lying against him, and her feet felt no weight, and she was held upright by the pressure of his body.</p><p class="calibre_10">They lay in bed together that night, and they did not know when they slept, the intervals of exhausted unconsciousness as intense an act of union as the convulsed meetings of their bodies.</p><p class="calibre_10">In the morning, when they were dressed, she watched him move about the room. She saw the drained relaxation of his movements; she thought of what she had taken from him, and the heaviness of her wrists told her that her own strength was now in his nerves, as if they had exchanged their energy.</p><p class="calibre_10">He was at the other end of the room, his back turned to her for a moment, when she said, “Roark,” her voice quiet and low.</p><p class="calibre_10">He turned to her, as if he had expected it and, perhaps, guessed the rest.</p><p class="calibre_10">She stood in the middle of the floor, as she had stood on her first night in this room, solemnly composed to the performance of a rite.</p><p class="calibre_10">“I love you, Roark.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She had said it for the first time.</p><p class="calibre_10">She saw the reflection of her next words on his face before she had pronounced them.</p><p class="calibre_10">“I was married yesterday. To Peter Keating.”</p><p class="calibre_10">It would have been easy, if she had seen a man distorting his mouth to bite off sound, closing his fists and twisting them in defense against himself. But it was not easy, because she did not see him doing this, yet knew that this was being done, without the relief of a physical gesture.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Roark ...” she whispered, gently, frightened.</p><p class="calibre_10">He said: “I’m all right.” Then he said: “Please wait a moment ... All right. Go on.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Roark, before I met you, I had always been afraid of seeing someone like you, because I knew that I’d also have to see what I saw on the witness stand and I’d have to do what I did in that courtroom. I hated doing it, because it was an insult to you to defend you—and it was an insult to myself that you had to be defended.... Roark, I can accept anything, except what seems to be the easiest for most people: the halfway, the almost, the just-about, the in-between. They may have their justifications. I don’t know. I don’t care to inquire. I know that it is the one thing not given me to understand. When I think of what you are, I can’t accept any reality except a world of your kind. Or at least a world in which you have a fighting chance and a fight on your own terms. That does not exist. And I can’t live a life torn between that which exists—and you. It would mean to struggle against things and men who don’t deserve to be your opponents. Your fight, using their methods—and that’s too horrible a desecration. It would mean doing for you what I did for Peter Keating: lie, flatter, evade, compromise, pander to every ineptitude—in order to beg of them a chance for you, beg them to let you live, to let you function, to beg them, Roark, not to laugh at them, but to tremble because they hold the power to hurt you. Am I too weak because I can’t do this? I don’t know which is the greater strength: to accept all this for you—or to love you so much that the rest is beyond acceptance. I don’t know. I love you too much.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He looked at her, waiting. She knew that he had understood this long ago, but that it had to be said.</p><p class="calibre_10">“You’re not aware of them. I am. I can’t help it. I love you. The contrast is too great. Roark, you won’t win, they’ll destroy you, but I won’t be there to see it happen. I will have destroyed myself first. That’s the only gesture of protest open to me. What else could I offer you? The things people sacrifice are so little. I’ll give you my marriage to Peter Keating. I’ll refuse to permit myself happiness in their world. I’ll take suffering. That will be my answer to them, and my gift to you. I shall probably never see you again. I shall try not to. But I will live for you, through every minute and every shameful act I take, I will live for you in my own way, in the only way I can.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He made a movement to speak, and she said:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Wait. Let me finish. You could ask, why not kill myself then. Because I love you. Because you exist. That alone is so much that it won’t allow me to die. And since I must be alive in order to know that you are, I will live in the world as it is, in the manner of life it demands. Not halfway, but completely. Not pleading and running from it, but walking out to meet it, beating it to the pain and the ugliness, being first to choose the worst it can do to me. Not as the wife of some half-decent human being, but as the wife of Peter Keating. And only within my own mind, only where nothing can touch it, kept sacred by the protecting wall of my own degradation, there will be the thought of you and the knowledge of you, and I shall say ‘Howard Roark’ to myself once in a while, and I shall feel that I have deserved to say it.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She stood before him, her face raised; her lips were not drawn, but closed softly, yet the shape of her mouth was too definite on her face, a shape of pain and tenderness, and resignation.</p><p class="calibre_10">In his face she saw suffering that was made old, as if it had been part of him for a long time, because it was accepted, and it looked not like a wound, but like a scar.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Dominique, if I told you now to have that marriage annulled at once—to forget the world and my struggle—to feel no anger, no concern, no hope—just to exist for me, for my need of you—as my wife—as my property ... ?”</p><p class="calibre_10">He saw in her face what she had seen in his when she told him of her marriage; but he was not frightened and he watched it calmly. After a while, she answered and the words did not come from her lips, but as if her lips were forced to gather the sounds from the outside:</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’d obey you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Now you see why I won’t do it. I won’t try to stop you. I love you, Dominique.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She closed her eyes, and he said:</p><p class="calibre_10">“You’d rather not hear it now? But I want you to hear it. We never need to say anything to each other when we’re together. This is—for the time when we won’t be together. I love you, Dominique. As selfishly as the fact that I exist. As selfishly as my lungs breathe air. I breathe for my own necessity, for the fuel of my body, for my survival. I’ve given you, not my sacrifice or my pity, but my ego and my naked need. This is the only way you can wish to be loved. This is the only way I can want you to love me. If you married me now, I would become your whole existence. But I would not want you then. You would not want yourself—and so you would not love me long. To say ‘I love you’ one must know first how to say the ‘I.’ The kind of surrender I could have from you now would give me nothing but an empty hulk. If I demanded it, I’d destroy you. That’s why I won’t stop you. I’ll let you go to your husband. I don’t know how I’ll live through tonight, but I will. I want you whole, as I am, as you’ll remain in the battle you’ve chosen. A battle is never selfless.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She heard, in the measured tension of his words, that it was harder for him to speak them than for her to listen. So she listened.</p><p class="calibre_10">“You must learn not to be afraid of the world. Not to be held by it as you are now. Never to be hurt by it as you were in that courtroom. I must let you learn it. I can’t help you. You must find your own way. When you have, you’ll come back to me. They won’t destroy me, Dominique. And they won’t destroy you. You’ll win, because you’ve chosen the hardest way of fighting for your freedom from the world. I’ll wait for you. I love you. I’m saying this now for all the years we’ll have to wait. I love you, Dominique.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Then he kissed her and he let her go.</p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_38"></div>
