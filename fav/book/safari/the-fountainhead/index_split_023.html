THIS WAS WHAT ONE FEELS IN NIGHTMARES, THOUGHT Peter Keating, only then one awakens when it becomes unbearable, but he could neither awaken nor bear it any longer. It had been growing, for days, for weeks, and now it had caught him: this lewd, unspeakable dread of defeat. He would lose the competition, he was certain that he would lose it, and the certainty grew as each day of waiting passed. He could not work; he jerked when people spoke to him; he had not slept for nights.</p><p class="calibre_10">He walked toward the house of Lucius Heyer. He tried not to notice the faces of the people he passed, but he had to notice; he had always looked at people; and people looked at him, as they always did. He wanted to shout at them and tell them to turn away, to leave him alone. They were staring at him, he thought, because he was to fail and they knew it.</p><p class="calibre_10">He was going to Heyer’s house to save himself from the coming disaster in the only way he saw left to him. If he failed in that competition—and he knew he was to fail—Francon would be shocked and disillusioned; then if Heyer died, as he could die at any moment, Francon would hesitate—in the bitter aftermath of a public humiliation—to accept Keating as his partner; if Francon hesitated, the game was lost. There were others waiting for the opportunity: Bennett, whom he had been unable to get out of the office; Claude Stengel, who had been doing very well on his own, and had approached Francon with an offer to buy Heyer’s place. Keating had nothing to count on, except Francon’s uncertain faith in him. Once another partner replaced Heyer, it would be the end of Keating’s future. He had come too close and had missed. That was never forgiven.</p><p class="calibre_10">Through the sleepless nights the decision had become clear and hard in his mind: he had to close the issue at once; he had to take advantage of Francon’s deluded hopes before the winner of the competition was announced; he had to force Heyer out and take his place; he had only a few days left.</p><p class="calibre_10">He remembered Francon’s gossip about Heyer’s character. He looked through the files in Heyer’s office and found what he had hoped to find. It was a letter from a contractor, written fifteen years ago; it stated merely that the contractor was enclosing a check for twenty thousand dollars due Mr. Heyer. Keating looked up the records for that particular building; it did seem that the structure had cost more than it should have cost. That was the year when Heyer had started his collection of porcelain.</p><p class="calibre_10">He found Heyer alone in his study. It was a small, dim room and the air in it seemed heavy, as if it had not been disturbed for years. The dark mahogany paneling, the tapestries, the priceless pieces of old furniture were kept faultlessly clean, but the room smelt, somehow, of indigence and of decay. There was a single lamp burning on a small table in a corner, and five delicate, precious cups of ancient porcelain on the table. Heyer sat hunched, examining the cups in the dim light, with a vague, pointless enjoyment. He shuddered a little when his old valet admitted Keating, and he blinked in vapid bewilderment, but he asked Keating to sit down.</p><p class="calibre_10">When he heard the first sounds of his own voice, Keating knew he had lost the fear that had followed him on his way through the streets; his voice was cold and steady. Tim Davis, he thought, Claude Stengel, and now just one more man to be removed.</p><p class="calibre_10">He explained what he wanted, spreading upon the still air of the room one short, concise, complete paragraph of thought, perfect as a gem with clean edges.</p><p class="calibre_10">“And so, unless you inform Francon of your retirement tomorrow morning,” he concluded, holding the letter by a corner between two fingers, <span class="italic">“this</span> goes to the A.G.A.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He waited. Heyer sat still, with his pale, bulging eyes blank and his mouth open in a perfect circle. Keating shuddered and wondered whether he was speaking to an idiot.</p><p class="calibre_10">Then Heyer’s mouth moved and his pale pink tongue showed, flickering against his lower teeth.</p><p class="calibre_10">“But I don’t want to retire.” He said it simply, guilelessly, in a little petulant whine.</p><p class="calibre_10">“You will have to retire.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t want to. I’m not going to. I’m a famous architect. I’ve always been a famous architect. I wish people would stop bothering me. They all want me to retire. I’ll tell you a secret.” He leaned forward; he whispered slyly: “You may not know it, but I know, he can’t deceive me: Guy wants me to retire. He thinks he’s outwitting me, but I can see through him. That’s a good one on Guy.” He giggled softly.</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t think you understood me. Do you understand this?” Keating pushed the letter into Heyer’s half-closed fingers.</p><p class="calibre_10">He watched the thin sheet trembling as Heyer held it. Then it dropped to the table and Heyer’s left hand with the paralyzed fingers jabbed at it blindly, purposelessly, like a hook. He said, gulping:</p><p class="calibre_10">“You can’t send this to the A.G.A. They’ll have my license taken away.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Certainly,” said Keating, “they will.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“And it will be in the papers.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“In all of them.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You can’t do that.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’m going to—unless you retire.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Heyer’s shoulders drew down to the edge of the table. His head remained above the edge, timidly, as if he were ready to draw it also out of sight.</p><p class="calibre_10">“You won’t do that please you won’t,” Heyer mumbled in one long whine without pauses. “You’re a nice boy you’re a very nice boy you won’t do it will you?”</p><p class="calibre_10">The yellow square of paper lay on the table. Heyer’s useless left hand reached for it, crawling slowly over the edge. Keating leaned forward and snatched the letter from under his hand.</p><p class="calibre_10">Heyer looked at him, his head bent to one side, his mouth open. He looked as if he expected Keating to strike him; with a sickening, pleading glance that said he would allow Keating to strike him.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Please,” whispered Heyer, “you won’t do that, will you? I don’t feel very well. I’ve never hurt you. I seem to remember, I did something very nice for you once.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“What?” snapped Keating. “What did you do for me?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Your name’s Peter Keating ... Peter Keating ... remember ... I did something nice for you.... You’re the boy Guy has so much faith in. Don’t trust Guy. I don’t trust him. But I like you. We’ll make you a designer one of these days.” His mouth remained hanging open on the word. A thin strand of saliva trickled down from the corner of his mouth. “Please ... don’t ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating’s eyes were bright with disgust; aversion goaded him on; he had to make it worse because he couldn’t stand it.</p><p class="calibre_10">“You’ll be exposed publicly,” said Keating, the sounds of his voice glittering. “You’ll be denounced as a grafter. People will point at you. They’ll print your picture in the papers. The owners of that building will sue you. They’ll throw you in jail.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Heyer said nothing. He did not move. Keating heard the cups on the table tinkling suddenly. He could not see the shaking of Heyer’s body. He heard a thin, glassy ringing in the silence of the room, as if the cups were trembling of themselves.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Get out!” said Keating, raising his voice, not to hear that sound. “Get out of the firm! What do you want to stay for? You’re no good. You’ve never been any good.”</p><p class="calibre_10">The yellow face at the edge of the table opened its mouth and made a wet, gurgling sound like a moan.</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating sat easily, leaning forward, his knees spread apart, one elbow resting on his knee, the hand hanging down, swinging the letter.</p><p class="calibre_10">“I ...” Heyer choked. “I ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Shut up! You’ve got nothing to say, except yes or no. Think fast now. I’m not here to argue with you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Heyer stopped trembling. A shadow cut diagonally across his face. Keating saw one eye that did not blink, and half a mouth, open, the darkness flowing in through the hole, into the face, as if it were drowning.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Answer me!” Keating screamed, frightened suddenly. “Why don’t you answer me?”</p><p class="calibre_10">The half-face swayed and he saw the head lurch forward; it fell down on the table, and went on, and rolled to the floor, as if cut off; two of the cups fell after it, cracking softly to pieces on the carpet. The first thing Keating felt was relief to see that the body had followed the head and lay crumpled in a heap on the floor, intact. There had been no sound; only the muffled, musical bursting of porcelain.</p><p class="calibre_10">He’ll be furious, thought Keating, looking down at the cups. He had jumped to his feet, he was kneeling, gathering the pieces pointlessly; he saw that they were broken beyond repair. He knew he was thinking also, at the same time, that it had come, that second stroke they had been expecting, and that he would have to do something about it in a moment, but that it was all right, because Heyer would have to retire now.</p><p class="calibre_10">Then he moved on his knees closer to Heyer’s body. He wondered why he did not want to touch it. “Mr. Heyer,” he called. His voice was soft, almost respectful. He lifted Heyer’s head, cautiously. He let it drop. He heard no sound of its falling. He heard the hiccough in his own throat. Heyer was dead.</p><p class="calibre_10">He sat beside the body, his buttocks against his heels, his hands spread on his knees. He looked straight ahead; his glance stopped on the folds of the hangings by the door; he wondered whether the gray sheen was dust or the nap of velvet and was it velvet and how old-fashioned it was to have hangings by a door. Then he felt himself shaking. He wanted to vomit. He rose, walked across the room and threw the door open, because he remembered that there was the rest of the apartment somewhere and a valet in it, and he called, trying to scream for help.</p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_10">Keating came to the office as usual. He answered questions, he explained that Heyer had asked him, that day, to come to his house after dinner; Heyer had wanted to discuss the matter of his retirement. No one doubted the story and Keating knew that no one ever would. Heyer’s end had come as everybody had expected it to come. Francon felt nothing but relief. “We knew he would, sooner or later,” said Francon. “Why regret that he spared himself and all of us a prolonged agony?”</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating’s manner was calmer than it had been for weeks. It was the calm of blank stupor. The thought followed him, gentle, unstressed, monotonous, at his work, at home, at night: he was a murderer ... no, but almost a murderer ... almost a murderer ... He knew that it had not been an accident; he knew he had counted on the shock and the terror; he had counted on that second stroke which would send Heyer to the hospital for the rest of his days. But was that all he had expected? Hadn’t he known what else a second stroke could mean? Had he counted on that? He tried to remember. He tried, wringing his mind dry. He felt nothing. He expected to feel nothing, one way or another. Only he wanted to know. He did not notice what went on in the office around him. He forgot that he had but a short time left to close the deal with Francon about the partnership.</p><p class="calibre_10">A few days after Heyer’s death Francon called him to his office.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Sit down, Peter,” he said with a brighter smile than usual. “Well, I have some good news for you, kid. They read Lucius’ will this morning. He had no relatives left, you know. Well, I was surprised, I didn’t give him enough credit, I guess, but it seems he could make a nice gesture on occasion. He’s left everything to you.... Pretty grand, isn’t it? Now you won’t have to worry about investment when we make arrangements for ... What’s the matter, Peter? ... Peter, my boy, are you sick?”</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating’s face fell upon his arm on the corner of the desk. He could not let Francon see his face. He was going to be sick; sick, because through the horror, he had caught himself wondering how much Heyer had actually left....</p><p class="calibre_10">The will had been made out five years ago; perhaps in a senseless spurt of affection for the only person who had shown Heyer consideration in the office; perhaps as a gesture against his partner; it had been made and forgotten. The estate amounted to two hundred thousand dollars, plus Heyer’s interest in the firm and his porcelain collection.</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating left the office early, that day, not hearing the congratulations. He went home, told the news to his mother, left her gasping in the middle of the living room, and locked himself in his bedroom. He went out, saying nothing, before dinner. He had no dinner that night, but he drank himself into a ferocious lucidity, at his favorite speak-easy. And in that heightened state of luminous vision, his head nodding over a glass but his mind steady, he told himself that he had nothing to regret; he had done what anyone would have done; Catherine had said it, he was selfish; everybody was selfish; it was not a pretty thing, to be selfish, but he was not alone in it; he had merely been luckier than most; he had been, because he was better than most; he felt fine; he hoped the useless questions would never come back to him again; every man for himself, he muttered, falling asleep on the table.</p><p class="calibre_10">The useless questions never came back to him again. He had no time for them in the days that followed. He had won the Cosmo-Slotnick competition.</p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_10">Peter Keating had known it would be a triumph, but he had not expected the thing that happened. He had dreamed of a sound of trumpets; he had not foreseen a symphonic explosion.</p><p class="calibre_10">It began with the thin ringing of a telephone, announcing the names of the winners. Then every phone in the office joined in, screaming, bursting from under the fingers of the operator who could barely control the switchboard; calls from every paper in town, from famous architects, questions, demands for interviews, congratulations. Then the flood rushed out of the elevators, poured through the office doors, the messages, the telegrams, the people Keating knew, the people he had never seen before, the reception clerk losing all sense, not knowing whom to admit or refuse, and Keating shaking hands, an endless stream of hands like a wheel with soft moist cogs flapping against his fingers. He did not know what he said at that first interview, with Francon’s office full of people and cameras; Francon had thrown the doors of his liquor cabinet wide-open. Francon gulped to all these people that the Cosmo-Slotnick building had been created by Peter Keating alone; Francon did not care; he was magnanimous in a spurt of enthusiasm; besides, it made a good story.</p><p class="calibre_10">It made a better story than Francon had expected. From the pages of newspapers the face of Peter Keating looked upon the country, the handsome, wholesome, smiling face with the brilliant eyes and the dark curls; it headed columns of print about poverty, struggle, aspiration and unremitting toil that had won their reward; about the faith of a mother who had sacrificed everything to her boy’s success; about the “Cinderella of Architecture.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Cosmo-Slotnick were pleased; they had not thought that prize-winning architects could also be young, handsome and poor—well, so recently poor. They had discovered a boy genius; Cosmo-Slotnick adored boy geniuses; Mr. Slotnick was one himself, being only forty-three.</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating’s drawings of the “most beautiful skyscraper on earth” were reproduced in the papers, with the words of the award underneath: “... for the brilliant skill and simplicity of its plan ... for its clean, ruthless efficiency ... for its ingenious economy of space ... for the masterful blending of the modern with the traditional in Art ... to Francon &amp; Heyer and Peter Keating ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating appeared in newsreels, shaking hands with Mr. Shupe and Mr. Slotnick, and the subtitle announced what these two gentlemen thought of his building. Keating appeared in newsreels, shaking hands with Miss Dimples Williams, and the subtitle announced what he thought of her current picture. He appeared at architectural banquets and at film banquets, in the place of honor, and he had to make speeches, forgetting whether he was to speak of buildings or of movies. He appeared at architectural clubs and at fan clubs. Cosmo-Slotnick put out a composite picture of Keating and of his building, which could be had for a self-addressed, stamped envelope, and two bits. He made a personal appearance each evening, for a week, on the stage of the Cosmo Theater, with the first run of the latest Cosmo-Slotnick special; he bowed over the footlights, slim and graceful in a black tuxedo, and he spoke for two minutes on the significance of architecture. He presided as judge at a beauty contest in Atlantic City, the winner to be awarded a screen test by Cosmo-Slotnick. He was photographed with a famous prizefighter, under the caption: “Champions.” A scale model of his building was made and sent on tour, together with the photographs of the best among the other entries, to be exhibited in the foyers of Cosmo-Slotnick theaters throughout the country.</p><p class="calibre_10">Mrs. Keating had sobbed at first, clasped Peter in her arms and gulped that she could not believe it. She had stammered, answering questions about Petey and she had posed for pictures, embarrassed, eager to please. Then she became used to it. She told Peter, shrugging, that of course he had won, it was nothing to gape at, no one else could have won. She acquired a brisk little tone of condescension for the reporters. She was distinctly annoyed when she was not included in the photographs taken of Petey. She acquired a mink coat.</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating let himself be carried by the torrent. He needed the people and the clamor around him. There were no questions and no doubts when he stood on a platform over a sea of faces; the air was heavy, compact, saturated with a single solvent—admiration; there was no room for anything else. He was great; great as the number of people who told him so. He was right; right as the number of people who believed it. He looked at the faces, at the eyes; he saw himself born in them, he saw himself being granted the gift of life. That was Peter Keating, that, the reflection in those staring pupils, and his body was only its reflection.</p><p class="calibre_10">He found time to spend two hours with Catherine, one evening. He held her in his arms and she whispered radiant plans for their future; he glanced at her with contentment; he did not hear her words; he was thinking of how it would look if they were photographed like this together and in how many papers it would be syndicated.</p><p class="calibre_10">He saw Dominque once. She was leaving the city for the summer. Dominque was disappointing. She congratulated him, quite correctly; but she looked at him as she had always looked, as if nothing had happened. Of all architectural publications, her column had been the only one that had never mentioned the Cosmo-Slotnick competition or its winner.</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’m going to Connecticut,” she told him. “I’m taking over Father’s place down there for the summer. He’s letting me have it all to myself. No, Peter, you can’t come to visit me. Not even once. I’m going there so I won’t have to see anybody.” He was disappointed, but it did not spoil the triumph of his days. He was not afraid of Dominique any longer. He felt confident that he could bring her to change her attitude, that he would see the change when she came back in the fall.</p><p class="calibre_10">But there was one thing which did spoil his triumph; not often and not too loudly. He never tired of hearing what was said about him; but he did not like to hear too much about his building. And when he had to hear it, he did not mind the comments on “the masterful blending of the modern with the traditional” in its façade; but when they spoke of the plan—and they spoke so much of the plan—when he heard about “the brilliant skill and simplicity ... the clean, ruthless efficiency ... the ingenious economy of space ...” when he heard it and thought of ... He did not think it. There were no words in his brain. He would not allow them. There was only a heavy, dark feeling—and a name.</p><p class="calibre_10">For two weeks after the award he pushed this thing out of his mind, as a thing unworthy of his concern, to be buried as his doubting, humble past was buried. All winter long he had kept his own sketches of the building with the pencil lines cut across them by another’s hand; on the evening of the award he had burned them; it was the first thing he had done.</p><p class="calibre_10">But the thing would not leave him. Then he grasped suddenly that it was not a vague threat, but a practical danger; and he lost all fear of it. He could deal with a practical danger, he could dispose of it quite simply. He chuckled with relief, he telephoned Roark’s office, and made an appointment to see him.</p><p class="calibre_10">He went to that appointment confidently. For the first time in his life he felt free of the strange uneasiness which he had never been able to explain or escape in Roark’s presence. He felt safe now. He was through with Howard Roark.</p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_10">Roark sat at the desk in his office, waiting. The telephone had rung once, that morning, but it had been only Peter Keating asking for an appointment. He had forgotten now that Keating was coming. He was waiting for the telephone. He had become dependent on that telephone in the last few weeks. He was to hear at any moment about his drawings for the Manhattan Bank Company.</p><p class="calibre_10">His rent on the office was long since overdue. So was the rent on the room where he lived. He did not care about the room; he could tell the landlord to wait; the landlord waited; it would not have mattered greatly if he had stopped waiting. But it mattered at the office. He told the rental agent that he would have to wait; he did not ask for the delay; he only said flatly, quietly, that there would be a delay, which was all he knew how to do. But his knowledge that he needed this alms from the rental agent, that too much depended on it, had made it sound like begging in his own mind. That was torture. All right, he thought, it’s torture. What of it?</p><p class="calibre_10">The telephone bill was overdue for two months. He had received the final warning. The telephone was to be disconnected in a few days. He had to wait. So much could happen in a few days.</p><p class="calibre_10">The answer of the bank board, which Weidler had promised him long ago, had been postponed from week to week. The board could reach no decision; there had been objectors and there had been violent supporters; there had been conferences; Weidler told him eloquently little, but he could guess much; there had been days of silence, of silence in the office, of silence in the whole city, of silence within him. He waited.</p><p class="calibre_10">He sat, slumped across the desk, his face on his arm, his fingers on the stand of the telephone. He thought dimly that he should not sit like that; but he felt very tired today. He thought that he should take his hand off that phone; but he did not move it. Well, yes, he depended on that phone; he could smash it, but he would still depend on it; he and every breath in him and every bit of him. His fingers rested on the stand without moving. It was this and the mail; he had lied to himself also about the mail; he had lied when he had forced himself not to leap, as a rare letter fell through the slot in the door, not to run forward, but to wait, to stand looking at the white envelope on the floor, then to walk to it slowly and pick it up. The slot in the door and the telephone—there was nothing else left to him of the world.</p><p class="calibre_10">He raised his head, as he thought of it, to look down at the door, at the foot of the door. There was nothing. It was late in the afternoon, probably past the time of the last delivery. He raised his wrist to glance at his watch; he saw his bare wrist; the watch had been pawned. He turned to the window; there was a clock he could distinguish on a distant tower; it was half past four; there would be no other delivery today.</p><p class="calibre_10">He saw that his hand was lifting the telephone receiver. His fingers were dialing the number.</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, not yet,” Weidler’s voice told him over the wire. “We had that meeting scheduled for yesterday, but it had to be called off.... I’m keeping after them like a bulldog.... I can promise you that we’ll have a definite answer tomorrow. I can almost promise you. If not tomorrow, then it will have to wait over the week end, but by Monday I promise it for certain.... You’ve been wonderfully patient with us, Mr. Roark. We appreciate it.” Roark dropped the receiver. He closed his eyes. He thought he would allow himself to rest, just to rest blankly like this for a few minutes, before he would begin to think of what the date on the telephone notice had been and in what way he could manage to last until Monday.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Hello, Howard,” said Peter Keating.</p><p class="calibre_10">He opened his eyes. Keating had entered and stood before him, smiling. He wore a light tan spring coat, thrown open, the loops of its belt like handles at his sides, a blue cornflower in his button hole. He stood, his legs apart, his fists on his hips, his hat on the back of his head, his black curls so bright and crisp over his pale forehead that one expected to see drops of spring dew glistening on them as on the cornflower.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Hello, Peter,” said Roark.</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating sat down comfortably, took his hat off, dropped it in the middle of the desk, and clasped one hand over each knee with a brisk little slap.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Well, Howard, things are happening, aren’t they?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Congratulations.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Thanks. What’s the matter, Howard? You look like hell. Surely, you’re not overworking yourself, from what I hear?”</p><p class="calibre_10">This was not the manner he had intended to assume. He had planned the interview to be smooth and friendly. Well, he decided, he’d switch back to that later. But first he had to show that he was not afraid of Roark, that he’d never be afraid again.</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, I’m not overworking.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Look, Howard, why don’t you drop it?”</p><p class="calibre_10">That was something he had not intended saying at all. His mouth remained open a little, in atonishment.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Drop what?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“The pose. Oh, the ideals, if you prefer. Why don’t you come down to earth? Why don’t you start working like everybody else? Why don’t you stop being a damn fool?” He felt himself rolling down a hill, without brakes. He could not stop.</p><p class="calibre_10">“What’s the matter, Peter?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“How do you expect to get along in the world? You have to live with people, you know. There are only two ways. You can join them or you can fight them. But you don’t seem to be doing either.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No. Not either.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“And people don’t want you. They <span class="italic">don’t want you!</span> Aren’t you afraid?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You haven’t worked for a year. And you won’t. Who’ll ever give you work? You might have a few hundreds left—and then it’s the end.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“That’s wrong, Peter. I have fourteen dollars left, and fifty-seven cents.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Well? And look at me! I don’t care if it’s crude to say that myself. That’s not the point. I’m not boasting. It doesn’t matter who says it. But look at me! Remember how we started? Then look at us now. And then think that it’s up to you. Just drop that fool delusion that you’re better than everybody else—and go to work. In a year, you’ll have an office that’ll make you blush to think of this dump. You’ll have people running after you, you’ll have clients, you’ll have friends, you’ll have an army of draftsmen to order around! ... Hell, Howard, it’s nothing to me—what can it mean to me?—but this time I’m not fishing for anything for myself, in fact I know that you’d make a dangerous competitor, but I’ve got to say this to you. Just think, Howard, think of it! you’ll be rich, you’ll be famous, you’ll be respected, you’ll be praised, you’ll be admired —you’ll be one of us! ... Well? ... Say something! Why don’t you say something?”</p><p class="calibre_10">He saw that Roark’s eyes were not empty and scornful, but attentive and wondering. It was close to some sort of surrender for Roark, because he had not dropped the iron sheet in his eyes, because he allowed his eyes to be puzzled and curious—and almost helpless.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Look, Peter. I believe you. I know that you have nothing to gain by saying this. I know more than that. I know that you don’t want me to succeed—it’s all right, I’m not reproaching you, I’ve always known it—you don’t want me ever to reach these things you’re offering me. And yet you’re pushing me on to reach them, quite sincerely. And you know that if I take your advice, I’ll reach them. And it’s not love for me, because that wouldn’t make you so angry—and so frightened.... Peter, what is it that disturbs you about me as I am?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t know ...” whispered Keating.</p><p class="calibre_10">He understood that it was a confession, that answer of his, and a terrifying one. He did not know the nature of what he had confessed and he felt certain that Roark did not know it either. But the thing had been bared; they could not grasp it, but they felt its shape. And it made them sit silently, facing each other, in astonishment, in resignation.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Pull yourself together, Peter,” said Roark gently, as to a comrade. “We’ll never speak of that again.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Then Keating said suddenly, his voice clinging in relief to the bright vulgarity of its new tone:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Aw hell, Howard, I was only talking good plain horse sense. Now if you wanted to work like a normal person—”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Shut up!” snapped Roark.</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating leaned back, exhausted. He had nothing else to say. He had forgotten what he had come here to discuss.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Now,” said Roark, “what did you want to tell me about the competition?”</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating jerked forward. He wondered what had made Roark guess that. And then it became easier, because he forgot the rest in a sweeping surge of resentment.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Oh, yes!” said Keating crisply, a bright edge of irritation in the sound of his voice. “Yes, I did want to speak to you about that. Thanks for reminding me. Of course, you’d guess it, because you know that I’m not an ungrateful swine. I really came here to thank you, Howard. I haven’t forgotten that you had a share in that building, you did give me some advice on it. I’d be the first one to give you part of the credit.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“That’s not necessary.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Oh, it’s not that I’d mind, but I’m sure you wouldn’t want me to say anything about it. And I’m sure you don’t want to say anything yourself, because you know how it is, people are so funny, they misinterpret everything in such a stupid way.... But since I’m getting part of the award money, I thought it’s only fair to let you have some of it. I’m glad that it comes at a time when you need it so badly.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He produced his billfold, pulled from it a check he had made out in advance and put it down on the desk. It read: “Pay to the order of Howard Roark—the sum of five hundred dollars.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Thank you, Peter,” said Roark, taking the check.</p><p class="calibre_10">Then he turned it over, took his fountain pen, wrote on the back: “Pay to the order of Peter Keating,” signed and handed the check to Keating.</p><p class="calibre_10">“And here’s my bribe to you, Peter,” he said. “For the same purpose. To keep your mouth shut.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating stared at him blankly.</p><p class="calibre_10">“That’s all I can offer you now,” said Roark. “You can’t extort anything from me at present, but later, when I’ll have money, I’d like to ask you please not to blackmail me. I’m telling you frankly that you could. Because I don’t want anyone to know that I had anything to do with that building.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He laughed at the slow look of comprehension on Keating’s face.</p><p class="calibre_10">“No?” said Roark. “You don’t want to blackmail me on that? ... Go home, Peter. You’re perfectly safe. I’ll never say a word about it. It’s yours, the building and every girder of it and every foot of plumbing and every picture of your face in the papers.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Then Keating jumped to his feet. He was shaking.</p><p class="calibre_10">“God damn you!” he screamed. “God damn you! Who do you think you are? Who told you that you could do this to people? So you’re too good for that building? You want to make me ashamed of it? You rotten, lousy, conceited bastard! Who are you? You don’t even have the wits to know that you’re a flop, an incompetent, a beggar, a failure, a failure, a failure! And you stand there pronouncing judgment! You, against the whole country! You against everybody! Why should I listen to you? You can’t frighten me. You can’t touch me. I have the whole world with me! ... Don’t stare at me like that! I’ve always hated you! You didn’t know that, did you? I’ve always hated you! I always will! I’ll break you some day, I swear I will, if it’s the last thing I do!”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Peter,” said Roark, “why betray so much?”</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating’s breath failed on a choked moan. He slumped down on a chair, he sat still, his hands clasping the sides of the seat under him.</p><p class="calibre_10">After a while he raised his head. He asked woodenly:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Oh God, Howard, what have I been saying?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Are you all right now? Can you go?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Howard, I’m sorry. I apologize, if you want me to.” His voice was raw and dull, without conviction. “I lost my head. Guess I’m just unstrung. I didn’t mean any of it. I don’t know why I said it. Honestly, I don’t.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Fix your collar. It’s unfastened.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I guess I was angry about what you did with that check. But I suppose you were insulted, too. I’m sorry. I’m stupid like that sometimes. I didn’t mean to offend you. We’ll just destroy the damn thing.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He picked up the check, struck a match, cautiously watched the paper burn till he had to drop the last scrap.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Howard, we’ll forget it?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Don’t you think you’d better go now?”</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating rose heavily, his hands poked about in a few useless gestures, and he mumbled:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Well ... well, goodnight, Howard. I ... I’ll see you soon.... It’s because so much’s happened to me lately.... Guess I need a rest.... So long, Howard....”</p><p class="calibre_10">When he stepped out into the hall and closed the door behind him, Keating felt an icy sense of relief. He felt heavy and very tired, but drearily sure of himself. He had acquired the knowledge of one thing: he hated Roark. It was not necessary to doubt and wonder and squirm in uneasiness any longer. It was simple. He hated Roark. The reasons? It was not necessary to wonder about the reasons. It was necessary only to hate, to hate blindly, to hate patiently, to hate without anger; only to hate, and let nothing intervene, and not let oneself forget, ever.</p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_10">The telephone rang late on Monday afternoon.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Mr. Roark?” said Weidler. “Can you come right over? I don’t want to say anything over the phone, but get here at once.” The voice sounded clear, gay, radiantly premonitory.</p><p class="calibre_10">Roark looked at the window, at the clock on the distant tower. He sat laughing at that clock, as at a friendly old enemy; he would not need it any longer, he would have a watch of his own again. He threw his head back in defiance to that pale, gray dial hanging high over the city.</p><p class="calibre_10">He rose and reached for his coat. He threw his shoulders back, slipping the coat on; he felt pleasure in the jolt of his muscles.</p><p class="calibre_10">In the street outside, he took a taxi which he could not afford.</p><p class="calibre_10">The chairman of the board was waiting for him in his office, with Weidler and with the vice-president of the Manhattan Bank Company. There was a long conference table in the room, and Roark’s drawings were spread upon it. Weidler rose when he entered and walked to meet him, his hand outstretched. It was in the air of the room, like an overture to the words Weidler uttered, and Roark was not certain of the moment when he heard them, because he thought he had heard them the instant he entered.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Well, Mr. Roark, the commission’s yours,” said Weidler.</p><p class="calibre_10">Roark bowed. It was best not to trust his voice for a few minutes.</p><p class="calibre_10">The chairman smiled amiably, inviting him to sit down. Roark sat down by the side of the table that supported his drawings. His hand rested on the table. The polished mahogany felt warm and living under his fingers; it was almost as if he were pressing his hand against the foundations of his building; his greatest building, fifty stories to rise in the center of Manhattan.</p><p class="calibre_10">“I must tell you,” the chairman was saying, “that we’ve had a hell of a fight over that building of yours. Thank God it’s over. Some of our members just couldn’t swallow your radical innovations. You know how stupidly conservative some people are. But we’ve found a way to please them, and we got their consent. Mr. Weidler here was really magnificently convincing on your behalf.”</p><p class="calibre_10">A great deal more was said by the three men. Roark barely heard it. He was thinking of the first bite of machine into earth that begins an excavation. Then he heard the chairman saying: “... and so it’s yours, on one minor condition.” He heard that and looked at the chairman.</p><p class="calibre_10">“It’s a small compromise, and when you agree to it we can sign the contract. It’s only an inconsequential matter of the building’s appearance. I understand that you modernists attach no great importance to a mere façade, it’s the plan that counts with you, quite rightly, and we wouldn’t think of altering your plan in any way, it’s the logic of the plan that sold us on the building. So I’m sure you won’t mind.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“What do you want?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“It’s only a matter of a slight alteration in the façade. I’ll show you. Our Mr. Parker’s son is studying architecture and we had him draw us up a sketch, just a rough sketch to illustrate what we had in mind and to show the members of the board, because they couldn’t have visualized the compromise we offered. Here it is.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He pulled a sketch from under the drawings on the table and handed it to Roark.</p><p class="calibre_10">It was Roark’s building on the sketch, very neatly drawn. It was his building, but it had a simplified Doric portico in front, a cornice on top, and his ornament was replaced by a stylized Greek ornament.</p><p class="calibre_10">Roark got up. He had to stand. He concentrated on the effort of standing. It made the rest easier. He leaned on one straight arm, his hand closed over the edge of the table, the tendons showing under the skin of his wrist.</p><p class="calibre_10">“You see the point?” said the chairman soothingly. “Our conservatives simply refused to accept a queer stark building like yours. And they claim that the public won’t accept it either. So we hit upon a middle course. In this way, though it’s not traditional architecture of course, it will give the public the <span class="italic">impression</span> of what they’re accustomed to. It adds a certain air of sound, stable dignity—and that’s what we want in a bank, isn’t it? It does seem to be an unwritten law that a bank must have a Classic portico—and a bank is not exactly the right institution to parade law-breaking and rebellion. Undermines that intangible feeling of confidence, you know. People don’t trust novelty. But this is the scheme that pleased everybody. Personally, I wouldn’t insist on it, but I really don’t see that it spoils anything. And that’s what the board has decided. Of course, we don’t mean that we want you to follow this sketch. But it gives you our general idea and you’ll work it out yourself, make your own adaptation of the Classic motive to the façade.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Then Roark answered. The men could not classify the tone of his voice; they could not decide whether it was too great a calm or too great an emotion. They concluded that it was calm, because the voice moved forward evenly, without stress, without color, each syllable spaced as by a machine; only the air in the room was not the air that vibrates to a calm voice.</p><p class="calibre_10">They concluded that there was nothing abnormal in the manner of the man who was speaking, except the fact that his right hand would not leave the edge of the table, and when he had to move the drawings, he did it with his left hand, like a man with one arm paralyzed.</p><p class="calibre_10">He spoke for a long time. He explained why this structure could not have a Classic motive on its façade. He explained why an honest building, like an honest man, had to be of one piece and one faith; what constituted the life source, the idea in any existing thing or creature, and why—if one smallest part committed treason to that idea—the thing or the creature was dead; and why the good, the high and the noble on earth was only that which kept its integrity.</p><p class="calibre_10">The chairman interrupted him:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Mr. Roark, I agree with you. There’s no answer to what you’re saying. But unfortunately, in practical life, one can’t always be so flawlessly consistent. There’s always the incalculable human element of emotion. We can’t fight that with cold logic. This discussion is actually superfluous. I can agree with you, but I can’t help you. The matter is closed. It was the board’s final decision—after more than usually prolonged consideration, as you know.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Will you let me appear before the board and speak to them?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’m sorry, Mr. Roark, but the board will not re-open the question for further debate. It was final. I can only ask you to state whether you agree to accept the commission on our terms or not. I must admit that the board has considered the possibility of your refusal. In which case, the name of another architect, one Gordon L. Prescott, has been mentioned most favorably as an alternative. But I told the board that I felt certain you would accept.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He waited. Roark said nothing.</p><p class="calibre_10">“You understand the situation, Mr. Roark?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes,” said Roark. His eyes were lowered. He was looking down at the drawings.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Well?”</p><p class="calibre_10">Roark did not answer.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes or no, Mr. Roark?”</p><p class="calibre_10">Roark’s head leaned back. He closed his eyes.</p><p class="calibre_10">“No,” said Roark.</p><p class="calibre_10">After a while the chairman asked:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Do you realize what you’re doing?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Quite,” said Roark.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Good God!” Weidler cried suddenly. “Don’t you know how big a commission this is? You’re a young man, you won’t get another chance like this. And ... all right, damn it all, I’ll say it! You need this! I know how badly you need it!”</p><p class="calibre_10">Roark gathered the drawings from the table, rolled them together and put them under his arm.</p><p class="calibre_10">“It’s sheer insanity!” Weidler moaned. “I want you. We want your building. You need the commission. Do you have to be quite so fanatical and selfless about it?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“What?” Roark asked incredulously.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Fanatical and selfless.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Roark smiled. He looked down at his drawings. His elbow moved a little, pressing them to his body. He said:</p><p class="calibre_10">“That was the most selfish thing you’ve ever seen a man do.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He walked back to his office. He gathered his drawing instruments and the few things he had there. It made one package and he carried it under his arm. He locked the door and gave the key to the rental agent. He told the agent that he was closing his office. He walked home and left the package there. Then he went to Mike Donnigan’s house.</p><p class="calibre_10">“No?” Mike asked, after one look at him.</p><p class="calibre_10">“No,” said Roark.</p><p class="calibre_10">“What happened?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’ll tell you some other time.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“The bastards!”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Never mind that, Mike.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“How about the office now?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’ve closed the office.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“For good?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“For the time being.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“God damn them all, Red! God damn them!”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Shut up. I need a job, Mike. Can you help me?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Me?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t know anyone in those trades here. Not anyone that would want me. You know them all.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“In what trades? What are you talking about?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“In the building trades. Structural work. As I’ve done before.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You mean—a plain workman’s job?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I mean a plain workman’s job.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You’re crazy, you God-damn fool!”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Cut it, Mike. Will you get me a job?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“But why in hell? You can get a decent job in an architect’s office. You know you can.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I won’t, Mike. Not ever again.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Why?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t want to touch it. I don’t want to see it. I don’t want to help them do what they’re doing.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You can get a nice clean job in some other line.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I would have to think on a nice clean job. I don’t want to think. Not their way. It will have to be their way, no matter where I go. I want a job where I won’t have to think.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Architects don’t take workmen’s jobs.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“That’s all this architect can do.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You can learn something in no time.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t want to learn anything.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You mean you want me to get you into a construction gang, here, in town?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“That’s what I mean.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, God damn you! I can‘t! I won’t! I won’t do it!”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Why?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Red, to be putting yourself up like a show for all the bastards in this town to see? For all the sons of bitches to know they brought you down like that? For all of them to gloat?”</p><p class="calibre_10">Roark laughed.</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t give a damn about that, Mike. Why should you?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Well, I’m not letting you. I’m not giving the sons of bitches that kinda treat.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Mike,” Roark said softly, “there’s nothing else for me to do.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Hell, yes, there is. I told you before. You’ll be listening to reason now. I got all the dough you need until ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’ll tell you what I’ve told Austen Heller: If you ever offer me money again, that’ll be the end between us.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“But why?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Don’t argue, Mike.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“But ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’m asking you to do me a bigger favor. I want that job. You don’t have to feel sorry for me. I don’t.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“But ... but what’ll happen to you, Red?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Where?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I mean ... your future?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’ll save enough money and I’ll come back. Or maybe someone will send for me before then.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Mike looked at him. He saw something in Roark’s eyes which he knew Roark did not want to be there.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Okay, Red,” said Mike softly.</p><p class="calibre_10">He thought it over for a long time. He said:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Listen, Red, I won’t get you a job in town. I just can’t. It turns my stomach to think of it. But I’ll get you something in the same line.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“All right. Anything. It doesn’t make any difference to me.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’ve worked for all of that bastard Francon’s pet contractors for so long I know everybody ever worked for him. He’s got a granite quarry down in Connecticut. One of the foremen’s a great pal of mine. He’s in town right now. Ever worked in a quarry before?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Once. Long ago.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Think you’ll like that?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Sure.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’ll go see him. We won’t be telling him who you are, just a friend of mine, that’s all.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Thanks, Mike.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Mike reached for his coat, and then his hands fell back, and he looked at the floor.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Red ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">“It will be all right, Mike.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Roark walked home. It was dark and the street was deserted. There was a strong wind. He could feel the cold, whistling pressure strike his cheeks. It was the only evidence of the flow ripping the air. Nothing moved in the stone corridor about him. There was not a tree to stir, no curtains, no awnings; only naked masses of stone, glass, asphalt and sharp corners. It was strange to feel that fierce movement against his face. But in a trash basket on a corner a crumpled sheet of newspaper was rustling, beating convulsively against the wire mesh. It made the wind real.</p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_10">In the evening, two days later, Roark left for Connecticut.</p><p class="calibre_10">From the train, he looked back once at the skyline of the city as it flashed into sight and was held for some moments beyond the windows. The twilight had washed off the details of the buildings. They rose in thin shafts of a soft, porcelain blue, a color not of real things, but of evening and distance. They rose in bare outlines, like empty molds waiting to be filled. The distance had flattened the city. The single shafts stood immeasurably tall, out of scale to the rest of the earth. They were of their own world, and they held up to the sky the statement of what man had conceived and made possible. They were empty molds. But man had come so far; he could go farther. The city on the edge of the sky held a question—and a promise.</p><p class="calibre_10">Little pinheads of light flared up about the peak of one famous tower, in the windows of the Star Roof Restaurant. Then the train swerved around a bend and the city vanished.</p><p class="calibre_10">That evening, in the banquet hall of the Star Roof Restaurant, a dinner was held to celebrate the admittance of Peter Keating to partnership in the firm to be known henceforward as Francon &amp; Keating.</p><p class="calibre_10">At the long table that seemed covered, not with a tablecloth, but with a sheet of light, sat Guy Francon. Somehow, tonight, he did not mind the streaks of silver that appeared on his temples; they sparkled crisply against the black of his hair and they gave him an air of cleanliness and elegance, like the rigid white of his shirt against his black evening clothes. In the place of honor sat Peter Keating. He leaned back, his shoulders straight, his hand closed about the stem of a glass. His black curls glistened against his white forehead. In that one moment of silence, the guests felt no envy, no resentment, no malice. There was a grave feeling of brotherhood in the room, in the presence of the pale, handsome boy who looked solemn as at his first communion. Ralston Holcombe had risen to speak. He stood, his glass in hand. He had prepared his speech, but he was astonished to hear himself saying something quite different, in a voice of complete sincerity. He said:</p><p class="calibre_10">“We are the guardians of a great human function. Perhaps of the greatest function among the endeavors of man. We have achieved much and we have erred often. But we are willing in all humility to make way for our heirs. We are only men and we are only seekers. But we seek for truth with the best there is in our hearts. We seek with what there is of the sublime granted to the race of men. It is a great quest. To the future of American Architecture!”</p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_23"></div>
