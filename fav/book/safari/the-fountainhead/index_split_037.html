Ellsworth Toohey wrote in his column: “Mr. Roark pulled a Phryne in court and didn’t get away with it. We never believed that story in the first place.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Roark was instructed to pay the costs of the Temple’s alterations. He said that he would not appeal the case. Hopton Stoddard announced that the Temple would be remodeled into the Hopton Stoddard Home for Subnormal Children.</p><p class="calibre_10">On the day after the end of the trial Alvah Scarret gasped when he glanced at the proofs of “Your House” delivered to his desk: the column contained most of Dominique’s testimony in court. Her testimony had been quoted in the newspaper accounts of the case but only in harmless excerpts. Alvah Scarret hurried to Dominique’s office.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Darling, darling, darling,” he said, “we can’t print that.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She looked at him blankly and said nothing.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Dominique, sweetheart, be reasonable. Quite apart from some of the language you use and some of your utterly unprintable ideas, you know very well the stand this paper has taken on the case. You know the campaign we’ve conducted. You’ve read my editorial this morning—‘A Victory for Decency.’ We can’t have one writer running against our whole policy.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You’ll have to print it.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“But, sweetheart ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Or I’ll have to quit.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Oh, go on, go on, go on, don’t be silly. Now don’t get ridiculous. You know better than that. We can’t get along without you. We can’t ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You’ll have to choose, Alvah.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Scarret knew that he would get hell from Gail Wynand if he printed the thing, and might get hell if he lost Dominique Francon whose column was popular. Wynand had not returned from his cruise. Scarret cabled him in Bali, explaining the situation.</p><p class="calibre_10">Within a few hours Scarret received an answer. It was in Wynand’s private code. Translated it read: FIRE THE BITCH. G. W.</p><p class="calibre_10">Scarret stared at the cable, crushed. It was an order that allowed no alternative, even if Dominique surrendered. He hoped she would resign. He could not face the thought of having to fire her.</p><p class="calibre_10">Through an office boy whom he had recommended for the job, Toohey obtained the decoded copy of Wynand’s cable. He put it in his pocket and went to Dominique’s office. He had not seen her since the trial. He found her engaged in emptying the drawers of her desk.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Hello,” he said curtly. “What are you doing?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Waiting to hear from Alvah Scarret.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Meaning?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Waiting to hear whether I’ll have to resign.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Feel like talking about the trial?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I do. I think I owe you the courtesy of admitting that you’ve done what no one has ever done before: you proved me wrong.” He spoke coldly; his face looked flat; his eyes had no trace of kindness. “I had not expected you to do what you did on the stand. It was a scurvy trick. Though up to your usual standard. I simply miscalculated the direction of your malice. However, you did have the good sense to admit that your act was futile. Of course, you made your point. And mine. As a token of appreciation, I have a present for you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He laid the cable on her desk.</p><p class="calibre_10">She read it and stood holding it in her hand.</p><p class="calibre_10">“You can’t even resign, my dear,” he said. “You can’t make that sacrifice to your pearl-casting hero. Remembering that you attach such great importance to not being beaten except by your own hand, I thought you would enjoy this.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She folded the cable and slipped it into her purse.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Thank you, Ellsworth.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“If you’re going to fight me, my dear, it will take more than speeches.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Haven’t I always?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes. Yes, of course you have. Quite right. You’re correcting me again. You have always fought me—and the only time you broke down and screamed for mercy was on that witness stand.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“That’s right.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“That’s where I miscalculated.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He bowed formally and left the room.</p><p class="calibre_10">She made a package of the things she wanted to take home. Then she went to Scarret’s office. She showed him the cable in her hand, but she did not give it to him.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Okay, Alvah,” she said.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Dominique, I couldn’t help it, I couldn’t help it, it was—How the hell did you get that?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“It’s all right, Alvah. No, I won’t give it back to you. I want to keep it.” She put the cable back in her bag. “Mail me my check and anything else that has to be discussed.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You ... you <span class="italic">were</span> going to resign anyway, weren’t you?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes, I was. But I like it better—being fired.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Dominique, if you knew how awful I feel about it. I can’t believe it. I simply can’t believe it.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“So you people made a martyr out of me, after all. And that is the one thing I’ve tried all my life not to be. It’s so graceless, being a martyr. It’s honoring your adversaries too much. But I’ll tell you this, Alvah—I’ll tell it to you, because I couldn’t find a less appropriate person to hear it: nothing that you do to me—or to him—will be worse than what I’ll do myself. If you think I can’t take the Stoddard Temple, wait till you see what I can take.”</p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_10">On an evening three days after the trial Ellsworth Toohey sat in his room, listening to the radio. He did not feel like working and he allowed himself a rest, relaxing luxuriously in an armchair, letting his fingers follow the rhythm of a complicated symphony. He heard a knock at his door. “Co-ome in,” he drawled.</p><p class="calibre_10">Catherine came in. She glanced at the radio by way of apology for her entrance.</p><p class="calibre_10">“I knew you weren’t working, Uncle Ellsworth. I want to speak to you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She stood slumped, her body thin and curveless. She wore a skirt of expensive tweed, unpressed. She had smeared some make-up on her face; the skin showed lifeless under the patches of powder. At twenty-six she looked like a woman trying to hide the fact of being over thirty.</p><p class="calibre_10">In the last few years, with her uncle’s help, she had become an able social worker. She held a paid job in a settlement house, she had a small bank account of her own; she took her friends out to lunch, older women of her profession, and they talked about the problems of unwed mothers, self-expression for the children of the poor and the evils of industrial corporations.</p><p class="calibre_10">In the last few years Toohey seemed to have forgotten her existence. But he knew that she was enormously aware of him in her silent, self-effacing way. He was seldom first to speak to her. But she came to him continuously for minor advice. She was like a small motor running on his energy, and she had to stop for refueling once in a while. She would not go to the theater without consulting him about the play. She would not attend a lecture course without asking his opinion. Once she developed a friendship with a girl who was intelligent, capable, gay and loved the poor, though a social worker. Toohey did not approve of the girl. Catherine dropped her.</p><p class="calibre_10">When she needed advice, she asked for it briefly, in passing, anxious not to delay him: between the courses of a meal, at the elevator door on his way out, in the living room when some important broadcast stopped for station identification. She made it a point to show that she would presume to claim nothing but the waste scraps of his time.</p><p class="calibre_10">So Toohey looked at her, surprised, when she entered his study. He said:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Certainly, pet. I’m not busy. I’m never too busy for you, anyway. Turn the thing down a bit, will you?”</p><p class="calibre_10">She softened the volume of the radio, and she slumped down in an armchair facing him. Her movements were awkward and contradictory, like an adolescent’s: she had lost the habit of moving with assurance, and yet, at times, a gesture, a jerk of her head, would show a dry, overbearing impatience which she was beginning to develop.</p><p class="calibre_10">She looked at her uncle. Behind her glasses, her eyes were still and tense, but unrevealing. She said:</p><p class="calibre_10">“What have you been doing, Uncle Ellsworth? I saw something in the papers about winning some big lawsuit that you were connected with. I was glad. I haven’t read the papers for months. I’ve been so busy ... No, that’s not quite true. I’ve had the time, but when I came home I just couldn’t make myself do anything, I just fell in bed and went to sleep. Uncle Ellsworth, do people sleep a lot because they’re tired or because they want to escape from something?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Now, my dear, this doesn’t sound like you at all. None of it.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She shook her head helplessly: “I know.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“What is the matter?”</p><p class="calibre_10">She said, looking at the toes of her shoes, her lips moving with effort:</p><p class="calibre_10">“I guess I’m no good, Uncle Ellsworth.” She raised her eyes to him. “I’m so terribly unhappy.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He looked at her silently, his face earnest, his eyes gentle. She whispered:</p><p class="calibre_10">“You understand?” He nodded. “You’re not angry at me? You don’t despise me?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“My dear, how could I?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I didn’t want to say it. Not even to myself. It’s not just tonight, it’s for a long time back. Just let me say everything, don’t be shocked, I’ve got to tell it. It’s like going to confession as I used to—oh, don’t think I’m returning to that, I know religion is only a ... a device of class exploitation, don’t think I’d let you down after you explained it all so well. I don’t miss going to church. But it’s just—it’s just that I’ve got to have somebody listen.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Katie, darling, first of all, why are you so frightened? You mustn’t be. Certainly not of speaking to me. Just relax, be yourself and tell me what happened.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She looked at him gratefully. “You’re ... so sensitive, Uncle Ellsworth. That’s one thing I didn’t want to say, but you guessed. I <span class="italic">am</span> frightened. Because—well, you see, you just said, be yourself. And what I’m afraid of most is of being myself. Because I’m vicious.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He laughed, not offensively, but warmly, the sound destroying her statement. But she did not smile.</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, Uncle Ellsworth, it’s true. I’ll try to explain. You see, always, since I was a child, I wanted to do right. I used to think everybody did, but now I don’t think so. Some people try their best, even if they do make mistakes, and others just don’t care. I’ve always cared. I took it very seriously. Of course I knew that I’m not a brilliant person and that it’s a very big subject, good and evil. But I felt that whatever is the good—as much as it would be possible for me to know—I would do my honest best to live up to it. Which is all anybody can try, isn’t it? This probably sounds terribly childish to you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, Katie, it doesn’t. Go on, my dear.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Well, to begin with, I knew that it was evil to be selfish. That much I was sure of. So I tried never to demand anything for myself. When Peter would disappear for months ... No, I don’t think you approve of that.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Of what, my dear?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Of Peter and me. So I won’t talk about that. It’s not important anyway. Well, you can see why I was so happy when I came to live with you. You’re as close to the ideal of unselfishness as anyone can be. I tried to follow you the best I could. That’s how I chose the work I’m doing. You never actually said that I should choose it, but I came to feel that you thought so. Don’t ask me how I came to feel it—it was nothing tangible, just little things you said. I felt very confident when I started. I knew that unhappiness comes from selfishness, and that one can find true happiness only in dedicating oneself to others. You said that. So many people have said that. Why, all the greatest men in history have been saying that for centuries.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“And?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Well, look at me.”</p><p class="calibre_10">His face remained motionless for a moment, then he smiled gaily and said:</p><p class="calibre_10">“What’s wrong with you, pet? Apart from the fact that your stockings don’t match and that you could be more careful about your make-up?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Don’t laugh, Uncle Ellsworth. Please don’t laugh. I know you say we must be able to laugh at everything, particularly at ourselves. Only—I can’t.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I won’t laugh, Katie. But what is the matter?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’m unhappy. I’m unhappy in such a horrible, nasty, undignified way. In a way that seems ... unclean. And dishonest. I go for days, afraid to think, to look at myself. And that’s wrong. It’s ... becoming a hypocrite. I always wanted to be honest with myself. But I’m not, I’m not, I’m not!”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Hold on, my dear. Don’t shout. The neighbors will hear you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She brushed the back of her hand against her forehead. She shook her head. She whispered:</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’m sorry.... I’ll be all right....”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Just why are you unhappy, my dear?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t know. I can’t understand it. For instance, it was I who arranged to have the classes in prenatal care down at the Clifford House —it was my idea-I raised the money—I found the teacher. The classes are doing very well. I tell myself that I should be happy about it. But I’m not. It doesn’t seem to make any difference to me. I sit down and I tell myself: It was you who arranged to have Marie Gonzales’ baby adopted into a nice family—now, be happy. But I’m not. I feel nothing. When I’m honest with myself, I know that the only emotion I’ve felt for years is being tired. Not physically tired. Just tired. It’s as if ... as if there were nobody there to feel any more.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She took off her glasses, as if the double barrier of her glasses and his prevented her from reaching him. She spoke, her voice lower, the words coming with greater effort:</p><p class="calibre_10">“But that’s not all. There’s something much worse. It’s doing something horrible to me. I’m beginning to hate people, Uncle Ellsworth. I’m beginning to be cruel and mean and petty in a way I’ve never been before. I expect people to be grateful to me. I ... I <span class="italic">demand</span> gratitude. I find myself pleased when slum people bow and scrape and fawn over me. I find myself liking only those who are servile. Once ... once I told a woman that she didn’t appreciate what people like us did for trash like her. I cried for hours afterward, I was so ashamed. I begin to resent it when people argue with me. I feel that they have no right to minds of their own, that I know best, that I’m the final authority for them. There was a girl we were worried about, because she was running around with a very handsome boy who had a bad reputation. I tortured her for weeks about it, telling her how he’d get her in trouble and that she should drop him. Well, they got married and they’re the happiest couple in the district. Do you think I’m glad? No, I’m furious and I’m barely civil to the girl when I meet her. Then there was a girl who needed a job desperately—it was really a ghastly situation in her home, and I promised that I’d get her one. Before I could find it, she got a good job all by herself. I wasn’t pleased. I was sore as hell that somebody got out of a bad hole without <span class="italic">my</span> help. Yesterday, I was speaking to a boy who wanted to go to college and I was discouraging him, telling him to get a good job, instead. I was quite angry, too. And suddenly I realized that it was because I had wanted so much to go to college—you remember, you wouldn’t let me—and so I wasn’t going to let that kid do it either.... Uncle Ellsworth, don’t you see? I’m becoming <span class="italic">selfish.</span> I’m becoming selfish in a way that’s much more horrible than if I were some petty chiseler pinching pennies off these people’s wages in a sweatshop!”</p><p class="calibre_10">He asked quietly:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Is that all?”</p><p class="calibre_10">She closed her eyes, and then she said, looking down at her hands:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes ... except that I’m not the only one who’s like that. A lot of them are, most of the women I work with.... I don’t know how they got that way.... I don’t know how it happened to me.... I used to feel happy when I helped somebody. I remember once—I had lunch with Peter that day—and on my way back I saw an old organ-grinder and I gave him five dollars I had in my bag. It was all the money I had; I’d saved it to buy a bottle of ‘Christmas Night,’ I wanted ‘Christmas Night’ very badly, but afterward every time I thought of that organ-grinder I was happy.... I saw Peter often in those days.... I’d come home after seeing him and I’d want to kiss every ragged kid on our block.... I think I hate the poor now.... I think all the other women do, too.... But the poor don’t hate us, as they should. They only despise us.... You know, it’s funny: it’s the masters who despise the slaves, and the slaves who hate the masters. I don’t know who is which. Maybe it doesn’t fit here. Maybe it does. I don’t know ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">She raised her head with a last spurt of rebellion.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Don’t you see what it is that I must understand? Why is it that I set out honestly to do what I thought was right and it’s making me rotten? I think it’s probably because I’m vicious by nature and incapable of leading a good life. That seems to be the only explanation. But ... but sometimes I think it doesn’t make sense that a human being is completely sincere in good will and yet the good is not for him to achieve. I can’t be as rotten as that. But ... but I’ve given up everything, I have no selfish desire left, I have nothing of my own—and I’m miserable. And so are the other women like me. And I don’t know a single selfless person in the world who’s happy—except you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She dropped her head and she did not raise it again; she seemed indifferent even to the answer she was seeking.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Katie,” he said softly, reproachfully, “Katie darling.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She waited silently.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Do you really want me to tell you the answer?” She nodded. “Because, you know, you’ve given the answer yourself, in the things you said.” She lifted her eyes blankly. “What have you been talking about? What have you been complaining about? About the fact that you are unhappy. About Katie Halsey and nothing else. It was the most egotistical speech I’ve ever heard in my life.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She blinked attentively, like a schoolchild disturbed by a difficult lesson.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Don’t you see how selfish you have been? You chose a noble career, not for the good you could accomplish, but for the personal happiness you expected to find in it.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“But I really wanted to help people.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Because you thought you’d be good and virtuous doing it.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Why—yes. Because I thought it was right. Is it vicious to want to do right?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes, if it’s your chief concern. Don’t you see how egotistical it is? To hell with everybody so long as I’m virtuous.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“But if you have no ... no self-respect, how can you be anything?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Why must you be anything?”</p><p class="calibre_10">She spread her hands out, bewildered.</p><p class="calibre_10">“If your first concern is for what you are or think or feel or have or haven’t got—you’re still a common egotist.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“But I can’t jump out of my own body.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No. But you can jump out of your narrow soul.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“You mean, I must <span class="italic">want</span> to be unhappy?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No. You must stop wanting <span class="italic">anything.</span> You must forget how important Miss Catherine Halsey is. Because, you see, she isn’t. Men are important only in relation to other men, in their usefulness, in the service they render. Unless you understand that completely, you can expect nothing but one form of misery or another. Why make such a cosmic tragedy out of the fact that you’ve found yourself feeling cruel toward people? So what? It’s just growing pains. One can’t jump from a state of animal brutality into a state of spiritual living without certain transitions. And some of them may seem evil. A beautiful woman is usually a gawky adolescent first. All growth demands destruction. You can’t make an omelet without breaking eggs. You must be willing to suffer, to be cruel, to be dishonest, to be unclean—anything, my dear, anything to kill the most stubborn of roots, the ego. And only when it is dead, when you care no longer, when you have lost your identity and forgotten the name of your soul—only then will you know the kind of happiness I spoke about, and the gates of spiritual grandeur will fall open before you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“But, Uncle Ellsworth,” she whispered, “when the gates fall open, who is it that’s going to enter?”</p><p class="calibre_10">He laughed aloud, crisply. It sounded like a laugh of appreciation. “My dear,” he said, “I never thought you could surprise me.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Then his face became earnest again.</p><p class="calibre_10">“It was a smart crack, Katie, but you know, I hope, that it was only a smart crack?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes,” she said uncertainly, “I suppose so. Still ...”</p><p class="calibre_10">“We can’t be too literal when we deal in abstractions. Of course it’s you who’ll enter. You won’t have lost your identity—you will merely have acquired a broader one, an identity that will be part of everybody else and of the whole universe.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“How? In what way? Part of what?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Now you see how difficult it is to discuss these things when our entire language is the language of individualism, with all its terms and superstitions. ‘Identity’—it’s an illusion, you know. But you can’t build a new house out of crumbling old bricks. You can’t expect to understand me completely through the medium of present-day conceptions. We are poisoned by the superstition of the ego. We cannot know what will be right or wrong in a selfless society, nor what we’ll feel, nor in what manner. We must destroy the ego first. That is why the mind is so unreliable. We must not think. We must believe. Believe, Katie, even if your mind objects. Don’t think. Believe. Trust your heart, not your brain. Don’t think. Feel. Believe.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She sat still, composed, but somehow she looked like something run over by a tank. She whispered obediently:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes, Uncle Ellsworth ... I ... I didn’t think of it that way. I mean, I always thought that I must think ... But you’re right, that is, if right is the word I mean, if there is a word ... Yes, I will believe.... I’ll try to understand.... No, not to understand. To feel. To believe, I mean.... Only I’m so weak.... I always feel so small after talking to you.... I suppose I was right in a way—I <span class="italic">am</span> worthless ... but it doesn’t matter ... it doesn’t matter....”</p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre_10">When the doorbell rang on the following evening Toohey went to open the door himself.</p><p class="calibre_10">He smiled when he admitted Peter Keating. After the trial he had expected Keating to come to him; he knew that Keating would need to come. But he had expected him sooner.</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating walked in uncertainly. His hands seemed too heavy for his wrists. His eyes were puffed, and the skin of his face looked slack.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Hello, Peter,” said Toohey brightly. “Want to see me? Come right in. Just your luck. I have the whole evening free.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No,” said Keating. “I want to see Katie.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He was not looking at Toohey and he did not see the expression behind Toohey’s glasses.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Katie? But of course!” said Toohey gaily. “You know, you’ve never come here to call on Katie, so it didn’t occur to me, but ... Go right in, I believe she’s home. This way—you don’t know her room?—second door.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Keating shuffled heavily down the hall, knocked on Catherine’s door and went in when she answered. Toohey stood looking after him, his face thoughtful.</p><p class="calibre_10">Catherine jumped to her feet when she saw her guest. She stood stupidly, incredulously for a moment, then she dashed to her bed to snatch a girdle she had left lying there and stuff it hurriedly under the pillow. Then she jerked off her glasses, closed her whole fist over them, and slipped them into her pocket. She wondered which would be worse: to remain as she was or to sit down at her dressing table and make up her face in his presence.</p><p class="calibre_10">She had not seen Keating for six months. In the last three years, they had met occasionally, at long intervals, they had had a few luncheons together, a few dinners, they had gone to the movies twice. They had always met in a public place. Since the beginning of his acquaintance with Toohey, Keating would not come to see her at her home. When they met, they talked as if nothing had changed. But they had not spoken of marriage for a long time.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Hello, Katie,” said Keating softly. “I didn’t know you wore glasses now.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“It’s just ... it’s only for reading.... I ... Hello, Peter.... I guess I look terrible tonight.... I’m glad to see you, Peter....”</p><p class="calibre_10">He sat down heavily, his hat in his hand, his overcoat on. She stood smiling helplessly. Then she made a vague, circular motion with her hands and asked:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Is it just for a little while or ... or do you want to take your coat off?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“No, it’s not just for a little while.” He got up, threw his coat and hat on the bed, then he smiled for the first time and asked: “Or are you busy and want to throw me out?”</p><p class="calibre_10">She pressed the heels of her hands against her eye sockets, and dropped her hands again quickly; she had to meet him as she had always met him, she had to sound light and normal: “No, no, I’m not busy at all.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He sat down and stretched out his arm in silent invitation. She came to him promptly, she put her hand in his, and he pulled her down to the arm of his chair.</p><p class="calibre_10">The lamplight fell on him, and she had recovered enough to notice the appearance of his face.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Peter,” she gasped, “what have you been doing to yourself? You look awful.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Drinking.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Not ... like that!”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Like that. But it’s over now.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“What was it?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I wanted to see you, Katie. I wanted to see you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Darling ... what have they done to you?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Nobody’s done anything to me. I’m all right now. I’m all right. Because I came here ... Katie, have you ever heard of Hopton Stoddard?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Stoddard? ... I don’t know. I’ve seen the name somewhere.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Well, never mind, it doesn’t matter. I was only thinking how strange it is. You see, Stoddard’s an old bastard who just couldn’t take his own rottenness any more, so to make up for it he built a big present to the city. But when I ... when I couldn’t take it any more, I felt that the only way I could make up for it was by doing the thing I really wanted to do most—by coming here.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“When you couldn’t take—what, Peter?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I’ve done something very dirty, Katie. I’ll tell you about it some day, but not now.... Look, will you say that you forgive me—without asking what it is? I’ll think ... I’ll think that I’ve been forgiven by someone who can never forgive me. Someone who can’t be hurt and so can’t forgive—but that makes it worse for me.”</p><p class="calibre_10">She did not seem perplexed. She said earnestly:</p><p class="calibre_10">“I forgive you, Peter.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He nodded his head slowly several times and said:</p><p class="calibre_10">“Thank you.”</p><p class="calibre_10">Then she pressed her head to his and she whispered:</p><p class="calibre_10">“You’ve gone through hell, haven’t you?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes. But it’s all right now.”</p><p class="calibre_10">He pulled her into his arms and kissed her. Then he did not think of the Stoddard Temple any longer, and she did not think of good and evil. They did not need to; they felt too clean.</p><p class="calibre_10">“Katie, why haven’t we married?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“I don’t know,” she said. And added hastily, saying it only because her heart was pounding, because she could not remain silent and because she felt called upon not to take advantage of him: “I guess it’s because we know we don’t have to hurry.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“But we do. If we’re not too late already.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Peter, you ... you’re not proposing to me again?”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Don’t look so stunned, Katie. If you do, I’ll know that you’ve doubted it all these years. And I couldn’t stand to think that just now. That’s what I came here to tell you tonight. We’re going to get married. We’re going to get married right away.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes, Peter.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“We don’t need announcements, dates, preparations, guests, any of it. We’ve let one of those things or another stop us every time. I honestly don’t know just how it happened that we’ve let it all drift like that.... We won’t say anything to anyone. We’ll just slip out of town and get married. We’ll announce and explain afterward, if anyone wants explanations. And that means your uncle, and my mother, and everybody.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes, Peter.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Quit your damn job tomorrow. I’ll make arrangements at the office to take a month off. Guy will be sore as hell—I’ll enjoy that. Get your things ready—you won’t need much—don’t bother about the make-up, by the way—did you say you looked terrible tonight?—you’ve never looked lovelier. I’ll be here at nine o’clock in the morning, day after tomorrow. You must be ready to start then.”</p><p class="calibre_10">“Yes, Peter.”</p><p class="calibre_10">After he had gone, she lay on her bed, sobbing aloud, without restraint, without dignity, without a care in the world.</p><p class="calibre_10">Ellsworth Toohey had left the door of his study open. He had seen Keating pass by the door without noticing it and go out. Then he heard the sound of Catherine’s sobs. He walked to her room and entered without knocking. He asked:</p><p class="calibre_10">“What’s the matter, my dear? Has Peter done something to hurt you?”</p><p class="calibre_10">She half lifted herself on the bed, she looked at him, throwing her hair back off her face, sobbing exultantly. She said without thinking the first thing she felt like saying. She said something which she did not understand, but he did: “I’m not afraid of you, Uncle Ellsworth!”</p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_37"></div>
