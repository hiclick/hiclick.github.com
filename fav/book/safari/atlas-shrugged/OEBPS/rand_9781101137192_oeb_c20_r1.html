<div class="ct">CHAPTER X</div>
<div class="cst">THE SIGN OF THE DOLLAR</div>
<div class="tx1">She sat at the window of the train, her head thrown back, not moving, wishing she would never have to move again.</div>
<div class="tx">The telegraph poles went racing past the window, but the train seemed lost in a void, between a brown stretch of prairie and a solid spread of rusty, graying clouds. The twilight was draining the sky without the wound of a sunset; it looked more like the fading of an anemic body in the process of exhausting its last drops of blood and light. The train was going west, as if it, too, were pulled to follow the sinking rays and quietly to vanish from the earth. She sat still, feeling no desire to resist it.</div>
<div class="tx">She wished she would not hear the sound of the wheels. They knocked in an even rhythm, every fourth knock accented—and it seemed to her that through the rapid, running clatter of some futile stampede to escape, the beat of the accented knocks was like the steps of an enemy moving toward some inexorable purpose.</div>
<div class="tx">She had never experienced it before, this sense of apprehension at the sight of a prairie, this feeling that the rail was only a fragile thread stretched across an enormous emptiness, like a worn nerve ready to break. She had never expected that she, who had felt as if she were the motive power aboard a train, would now sit wishing, like a child or a savage, that this train would move, that it would not stop, that it would get her there on time—wishing it, not like an act of will, but like a plea to a dark unknown.</div>
<div class="tx">She thought of what a difference one month had made. She had seen it in the faces of the men at the stations. The track workers, the switchmen, the yardmen, who had always greeted her, anywhere along the line, their cheerful grins boasting that they knew who she was—had now looked at her stonily, turning away, their faces wary and closed. She had wanted to cry to them in apology, “It’s not I who’ve done it to you!”—then had remembered that she had accepted it and that they now had the right to hate her, that she was both a slave and a driver of slaves, and so was every human being in the country, and hatred was the only thing that men could now feel for one another.</div>
<div class="tx">She had found reassurance, for two days, in the sight of the cities  moving past her window—the factories, the bridges, the electric signs, the billboards pressing down upon the roofs of homes—the crowded, grimy, active, living conflux of the industrial East.</div>
<div class="tx">But the cities had been left behind. The train was now diving into the prairies of Nebraska, the rattle of its couplers sounding as if it were shivering with cold. She saw lonely shapes that had been farmhouses in the vacant stretches that had been fields. But the great burst of energy, in the East, generations ago, had splattered bright trickles to run through the emptiness; some were gone, but some still lived. She was startled when the lights of a small town swept across her car and, vanishing, left it darker than it had been before. She would not move to turn on the light. She sat still, watching the rare towns. Whenever an electric beam went flashing briefly at her face, it was like a moment’s greeting.</div>
<div class="tx">She saw them as they went by, written on the walls of modest structures, over sooted roofs, down slender smokestacks, on the curves of tanks: Reynolds Harvesters—Macey Cement—Quinlan &amp; Jones Pressed Alfalfa—Home of the Crawford Mattress—Benjamin Wylie Grain and Feed—words raised like flags to the empty darkness of the sky, the motionless forms of movement, of effort, of courage, of hope, the monuments to how much had been achieved on the edge of nature’s void by men who had once been free to achieve—she saw the homes built in scattered privacy, the small shops, the wide streets with electric lighting, like a few luminous strokes criss-crossed on the black sheet of the wastelands—she saw the ghosts between, the remnants of towns, the skeletons of factories with crumbling smokestacks, the corpses of shops with broken panes, the slanting poles with shreds of wire—she saw a sudden blaze, the rare sight of a gas station, a glittering white island of glass and metal under the huge black weight of space and sky -she saw an ice-cream cone made of radiant tubing, hanging above the corner of a street, and a battered car being parked below, with a young boy at the wheel and a girl stepping out, her white dress blowing in the summer wind—she shuddered for the two of them, thinking: I can’t look at you, I who know what it has taken to give you your youth, to give you this evening, this car and the ice-cream cone you’re going to buy for a quarter—she saw, on the edge beyond a town, a building glowing with tiers of pale blue light, the industrial light she loved, with the silhouettes of machines in its windows and a billboard in the darkness above its roof—and suddenly her head fell on her arm, and she sat shaking, crying soundlessly to the night, to herself, to whatever was human in any living being: Don’t let it go! ... Don’t let it go! ...</div>
<div class="tx">She jumped to her feet and snapped on the light. She stood still, fighting to regain control, knowing that such moments were her greatest danger. The lights of the town were past, her window was now an empty rectangle, and she heard, in the silence, the progression of the fourth  knocks, the steps of the enemy moving on, not to be hastened or stopped.</div>
<div class="tx">In desperate need of the sight of some living activity, she decided she would not order dinner in her car, but would go to the diner. As if stressing and mocking her loneliness, a voice came back to her mind: “But you would not run trains if they were empty.” Forget it!—she told herself angrily, walking hastily to the door of her car.</div>
<div class="tx">She was astonished, approaching her vestibule, to hear the sound of voices close by. As she pulled the door open, she heard a shout: “Get off, God damn you!”</div>
<div class="tx">An aging tramp had taken refuge in the corner of her vestibule. He sat on the floor, his posture suggesting that he had no strength left to stand up or to care about being caught. He was looking at the conductor, his eyes observant, fully conscious, but devoid of any reaction. The train was slowing down for a bad stretch of track, the conductor had opened the door to a cold gust of wind, and was waving at the speeding black void, ordering, “Get going! Get off as you got on or I’ll kick you off head first!”</div>
<div class="tx">There was no astonishment in the tramp’s face, no protest, no anger, no hope; he looked as if he had long since abandoned any judgment of any human action. He moved obediently to rise, his hand groping upward along the rivets of the car’s wall. She saw him glance at her and glance away, as if she were merely another inanimate fixture of the train. He did not seem to be aware of her person, any more than of his own, he was indifferently ready to comply with an order which, in his condition, meant certain death.</div>
<div class="tx">She glanced at the conductor. She saw nothing in his face except the blind malevolence of pain, of some long-repressed anger that broke out upon the first object available, almost without consciousness of the object’s identity. The two men were not human beings to each other any longer.</div>
<div class="tx">The tramp’s suit was a mass of careful patches on a cloth so stiff and shiny with wear that one expected it to crack like glass if bent; but she noticed the collar of his shirt: it was bone-white from repeated laundering and it still preserved a semblance of shape. He had pulled himself up to his feet, he was looking indifferently at the black hole open upon miles of uninhabited wilderness where no one would see the body or hear the voice of a mangled man, but the only gesture of concern he made was to tighten his grip on a small, dirty bundle, as if to make sure he would not lose it in leaping off the train.</div>
<div class="tx">It was the laundered collar and this gesture for the last of his possessions—the gesture of a sense of property—that made her feel an emotion like a sudden, burning twist within her. “Wait,” she said.</div>
<div class="tx">The two men turned to her.</div>
<div class="tx">“Let him be my guest,” she said to the conductor, and held her door open for the tramp, ordering, “Come in.”</div>
<div class="tx">The tramp followed her, obeying as blankly as he had been about to obey the conductor.</div>
<div class="tx">He stood in the middle of her car, holding his bundle, looking around him with the same observant, unreacting glance.</div>
<div class="tx">“Sit down,” she said.</div>
<div class="tx">He obeyed—and looked at her, as if waiting for further orders. There was a kind of dignity in his manner, the honesty of the open admission that he had no claim to make, no plea to offer, no questions to ask, that he now had to accept whatever was done to him and was ready to accept it.</div>
<div class="tx">He seemed to be in his early fifties; the structure of his bones and the looseness of his suit suggested that he had once been muscular. The lifeless indifference of his eyes did not fully hide that they had been intelligent; the wrinkles cutting his face with the record of some incredible bitterness, had not fully erased the fact that the face had once possessed the kindliness peculiar to honesty.</div>
<div class="tx">“When did you eat last?” she asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yesterday,” he said, and added, “I think.”</div>
<div class="tx">She rang for the porter and ordered dinner for two, to be brought to her car from the diner.</div>
<div class="tx">The tramp had watched her silently, but when the porter departed, he offered the only payment it was in his power to offer: “I don’t want to get you in trouble, ma.‘am,” he said.</div>
<div class="tx">She smiled. “What trouble?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re traveling with one of those railroad tycoons, aren’t you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, alone.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then you’re the wife of one of them?”</div>
<div class="tx">.“No.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh.” She saw his effort at a look of something like respect, as if to make up for having forced an improper confession, and she laughed.</div>
<div class="tx">“No, not that, either. I guess I’m one of the tycoons myself. My name is Dagny Taggart and I work for this railroad.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh ... I think I’ve heard of you, ma.‘am—in the old days.” It was hard to tell what “the old days” meant to him, whether it was a month or a year or whatever period of time had passed since he had given up. He was looking at her with a sort of interest in the past tense, as if he were thinking that there had been a time when he would have considered her a personage worth seeing. “You were the lady who ran a railroad,” he said.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes,” she said. “I was.”</div>
<div class="tx">He showed no sign of astonishment at the fact that she had chosen to help him. He looked as if so much brutality had confronted him that he had given up the attempt to understand, to trust or to expect anything.</div>
<div class="tx">“When did you get aboard the train?” she asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“Back at the division point, ma.‘am. Your door wasn’t locked.” He  added, “I figured maybe nobody would notice me till morning on account of it being a private car.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Where are you going?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know.” Then, almost as if he sensed that this could sound too much like an appeal for pity, he added, “I guess I just wanted to keep moving till I saw some place that looked like there might be a chance to find work there.” This was his attempt to assume the responsibility of a purpose, rather than to throw the burden of his aimlessness upon her mercy—an attempt of the same order as his shirt collar.</div>
<div class="tx">“What kind of work are you looking for?”</div>
<div class="tx">“People don’t look for kinds of work any more, ma.‘am,” he answered impassively. “They just look for work.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What sort of place did you hope to find?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh ... well ... where there’s factories, I guess.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Aren’t you going in the wrong direction for that? The factories are in the East.”</div>
<div class="tx">“No.” He said it with the firmness of knowledge. “There are too many people in the East. The factories are too well watched. I figured there might be a better chance some place where there’s fewer people and less law.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, running away? A fugitive from the law, are you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Not as you’d mean it in the old days, ma.‘am. But as things are now, I guess I am. I want to work.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What do you mean?”</div>
<div class="tx">“There aren’t any jobs back East. And a man couldn’t give you a job, if he had one to give—he’d go to jail for it. He’s watched. You can’t get work except through the Unification Board. The Unification Board has a gang of its own friends waiting in line for the jobs, more friends than a millionaire’s got relatives. Well, me—I haven’t got either.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Where did you work last?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’ve been bumming around the country for six months—no, longer, I guess—I guess it’s closer to about a year—I can’t tell any more—mostly day work it was. Mostly on farms. But it’s getting to be no use now. I know how the farmers look at you—they don’t like to see a man starving, but they’re only one jump ahead of starvation themselves, they haven’t any work to give you, they haven’t any food, and whatever they save, if the tax collectors don’t get it, then the raiders do—you know, the gangs that rove all through the country—deserters, they call them.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you think that it’s any better in the West?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. I don’t.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then why are you going there?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Because I haven’t tried it before. That’s all there is left to try. It’s somewhere to go. Just to keep moving ... You know,” he added  suddenly, “I don’t think it will be any use. But there’s nothing to do in the East except sit under some hedge and wait to die. I don’t think I’d mind it much now, the dying. I know it would be a lot easier. Only I think that it’s a sin to sit down and let your life go, without making a try for it.”</div>
<div class="tx">She thought suddenly of those modern college-infected parasites who assumed a sickening air of moral self-righteousness whenever they uttered the standard bromides about their concern for the welfare of others. The tramp’s last sentence was one of the most profoundly moral statements she had ever heard; but the man did not know it; he had said it in his impassive, extinguished voice, simply, dryly, as a matter of fact.</div>
<div class="tx">“What part of the country do you come from?” she asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“Wisconsin,” he answered.</div>
<div class="tx">The waiter came in, bringing their dinner. He set a table and courteously moved two chairs, showing no astonishment at the nature of the occasion.</div>
<div class="tx">She looked at the table; she thought that the magnificence of a world where men could afford the time and the effortless concern for such things as starched napkins and tinkling ice cubes, offered to travelers along with their meals for the price of a few dollars, was a remnant of the age when the sustenance of one’s life had not been made a crime and a meal had not been a matter of running a race with death—a remnant which was soon to vanish, like the white filling station on the edge of the weeds of the jungle.</div>
<div class="tx">She noticed that the tramp, who had lost the strength to stand up, had not lost the respect for the meaning of the things spread before him. He did not pounce upon the food; he fought to keep his movements slow, to unfold his napkin, to pick up his fork in tempo with hers, his hand shaking—as if he still knew that this, no matter what indignity was ever forced upon them, was the manner proper to men.</div>
<div class="tx">“What was your line of work—in the old days?” she asked, when the waiter left. “Factories, wasn’t it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, ma.‘am.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What trade?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Skilled lathe-operator.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Where did you work at it last?”</div>
<div class="tx">“In Colorado, ma.‘am. For the Hammond Car Company.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh ... !”</div>
<div class="tx">“Ma.‘am?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, nothing. Worked there long?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, ma.‘am. Just two weeks.”</div>
<div class="tx">“How come?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, I’d waited a year for it, hanging around Colorado just to get that job. They had a waiting list too, the Hammond Car Company, only they didn’t go by friendships and they didn’t go by seniority,  they went by a man’s record. I had a good record. But it was just two weeks after I got the job that Lawrence Hammond quit. He quit and disappeared. They closed the plant. Afterwards, there was a citizens’ committee that reopened it. I got called back. But five days was all it lasted. They started layoffs just about at once. By seniority. So I had to go. I heard they lasted for about three months, the citizens’ committee. Then they had to close the plant for good.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Where did you work before that?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Just about in every Eastern state, ma.‘am. But it was never more than a month or two. The plants kept closing.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did that happen on every job you’ve held?”</div>
<div class="tx">He glanced at her, as if he understood her question. “No, ma.‘am,” he answered and, for the first time, she caught a faint echo of pride in his voice. “The first job I had, I held it for twenty years. Not the same job, but the same place, I mean—I got to be shop foreman. That was twelve years ago. Then the owner of the plant died, and the heirs who took it over, ran it into the ground. Times were bad then, but it was since then that things started going to pieces everywhere faster and faster. Since then, it seems like anywhere I turned—the place cracked and went. At first, we thought it was only one state or another. A lot of us thought that Colorado would last. But it went, too. Anything you tried, anything you touched—it fell. Anywhere you looked, work was stopping—the factories were stopping—the machines were stopping—” he added slowly, in a whisper, as if seeing some secret terror of his own, <i>“the motors ... were ... stopping.”</i> His voice rose: “Oh God, who is—” and broke off.</div>
<div class="tx">“—John Galt?” she asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes,” he said, and shook his head as if to dispel some vision, “only I don’t like to say that.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don.‘t, either. I wish I knew why people are saying it and who .started it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s it, ma.‘am. That’s what I’m afraid of. It might have been me who started it.”</div>
<div class="tx"><i>“What?”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“Me or about six thousand others. We might have. I think we did. I hope we’re wrong.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What do you mean?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, there was something that happened at that plant where I worked for twenty years. It was when the old man died and his heirs took over. There were three of them, two sons and a daughter, and they brought a new plan to run the factory. They let us vote on it, too, and everybody—almost everybody—voted for it. We didn’t know. We thought it was good. No, that’s not true, either. We thought that we were supposed to think it was good. The plan was that everybody in the factory would work according to his ability, but would be paid  according to his need. We—what’s the matter, ma.‘am? Why do you look like that?”</div>
<div class="tx">“What was the name of the factory?” she asked, her voice barely audible.</div>
<div class="tx">“The Twentieth Century Motor Company, ma.‘am, of Starnesville, Wisconsin.”</div>
<div class="tx">.“Go on.”</div>
<div class="tx">“We voted for that plan at a big meeting, with all of us present, six thousand of us, everybody that worked in the factory. The Starnes heirs made long speeches about it, and it wasn’t too clear, but nobody asked any questions. None of us knew just how the plan would work, but every one of us thought that the next fellow knew it. And if anybody had doubts, he felt guilty and kept his mouth shut—because they made it sound like anyone who’d oppose the plan was a child-killer at heart and less than a human being. They told us that this plan would achieve a noble ideal. Well, how were we to know otherwise ? Hadn’t we heard it all our lives—from our parents and our school-teachers and our ministers, and in every newspaper we ever read and every movie and every public speech? Hadn’t we always been told that this was righteous and just? Well, maybe there’s some excuse for what we did at that meeting. Still, we voted for the plan—and what we got, we had it coming to us. You know, ma.‘am, we are marked men, in a way, those of us who lived through the four years of that plan in the Twentieth Century factory. What is it that hell is supposed to be? Evil—plain, naked, smirking evil, isn’t it? Well, that’s what we saw and helped to make—and I think we’re damned, every one of us, and maybe we’ll never be forgiven....</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you know how it worked, that plan, and what it did to people? Try pouring water into a tank where there’s a pipe at the bottom draining it out faster than you pour it, and each bucket you bring breaks that pipe an inch wider, and the harder you work the more is demanded of you, and you stand slinging buckets forty hours a week, then forty-eight, then fifty-six-for your neighbor’s supper—for his wife’s operation—for his child’s measles—for his mother’s wheel chair -for his uncle’s shirt—for his nephew’s schooling—for the baby next door—for the baby to be born—for anyone anywhere around you—it’s theirs to receive, from diapers to dentures—and yours to work, from sunup to sundown, month after month, year after year, with nothing to show for it but your sweat, with nothing in sight for you but their pleasure, for the whole of your life, without rest, without hope, without end.... From each according to his ability, to each according to his need....</div>
<div class="tx">“We’re all one big family, they told us, we’re all in this together. But you don’t all stand working an acetylene torch ten hours a day—together, and you don’t all get a bellyache—together. What’s whose  ability and which of whose needs comes first? When it’s all one pot, you can’t let any man decide what his own needs are, can you? If you did, he might claim that he needs a yacht—and if his feelings is all you have to go by, he might prove it, too. Why not? If it’s not right for me to own a car until I’ve worked myself into a hospital ward, earning a car for every loafer and every naked savage on earth—why can’t he demand a yacht from me, too, if I still have the ability not to have collapsed ? No? He can’t? Then why can he demand that I go without cream for my coffee until he’s replastered his living room? ... Oh well ... Well, anyway, it was decided that nobody had the right to judge his own need or ability. We voted on it. Yes, ma‘am, we voted on it in a public meeting twice a year. How else could it be done? Do you care to think what would happen at such a meeting? It took us just one meeting to discover that we had become beggars—rotten, whining, sniveling beggars, all of us, because no man could claim his pay as his rightful earning, he had no rights and no earnings, his work didn’t belong to him, it belonged to ’.the family,‘. and they owed him nothing in return, and the only claim he had on them was his ’.need’ -so he had to beg in public for relief from his needs, like any lousy moocher, listing all his troubles and miseries, down to his patched drawers and his wife’s head colds, hoping that .‘the family’ would throw him the alms. He had to claim miseries, because it’s miseries, not work, that had become the coin of the realm—so it turned into a contest among six thousand panhandlers, each claiming that <i>his</i> need was worse than his brother’s. How else could it be done? Do you care to guess what happened, what sort of men kept quiet, feeling shame, and what sort got away with the jackpot?</div>
<div class="tx">“But that wasn’t all. There was something else that we discovered at the same meeting. The factory’s production had fallen by forty per cent, in that first half-year, so it was decided that somebody hadn’t delivered ‘according to his ability.’ Who? How would you tell it? .‘The family’ voted on that, too. They voted which men were the best, and these men were sentenced to work overtime each night for the next six months. Overtime without pay—because you weren’t paid by time and you weren’t paid by work, only by need.</div>
<div class="tx">“Do I have to tell you what happened after that—and into what sort of creatures we all started turning, we who had once been human? We began to hide whatever ability we had, to slow down and watch like hawks that we never worked any faster or better than the next fellow. What else could we do, when we knew that if we did our best for ‘the family,’ it’s not thanks or rewards that we’d get, but punishment ? We knew that for every stinker who’d ruin a batch of motors and cost the company money—either through his sloppiness, because he didn’t have to care, or through plain incompetence—it’s we who’d have to pay with our nights and our Sundays. So we did our best to be no good.</div>
<div class="tx">“There was one young boy who started out, full of fire for the noble ideal, a bright kid without any schooling, but with a wonderful head on his shoulders. The first year, he figured out a work process that saved us thousands of man-hours. He gave it to ‘the family,’ didn’t ask anything for it, either, couldn’t ask, but that was all right with him. It was for the ideal, he said. But when he found himself voted as one of our ablest and sentenced to night work, because we hadn’t gotten enough from him, he shut his mouth and his brain. You can bet he didn’t come up with any ideas, the second year.</div>
<div class="tx">“What was it they’d always told us about the vicious competition of the profit system, where men had to compete for who’d do a better job than his fellows? Vicious, wasn’t it? Well, they should have seen what it was like when we all had to compete with one another for who’d do the worst job possible. There’s no surer way to destroy a man than to force him into a spot where he has to aim at not doing his best, where he has to struggle to do a bad job, day after day. That will finish him quicker than drink or idleness or pulling stick-ups for a living. But there was nothing else for us to do except to fake unfitness. The one accusation we feared was to be suspected of ability. Ability was like a mortgage on you that you could never pay off. And what was there to work for? You knew that your basic pittance would be given to you anyway, whether you worked or not—your ‘housing and feeding allowance,’ it was called—and above that pittance, you had no chance to get anything, no matter how hard you tried. You couldn’t count on buying a new suit of clothes next year—they might give you a .‘clothing allowance’ or they might not, according to whether nobody broke a leg, needed an operation or gave birth to more babies. And if there wasn’t enough money for new suits for everybody, then you couldn’t get yours, either.</div>
<div class="tx">“There was one man who’d worked hard all his life, because he’d always wanted to send his son through college. Well, the boy graduated from high school in the second year of the plan—but ‘the family’ wouldn’t give the father any ’.allowance’ for the college. They said his son couldn’t go to college, until we had enough to send everybody’s sons to college—and that we first had to send everybody’s children through high school, and we didn’t even have enough for that. The father died the following year, in a knife fight with somebody in a saloon, a fight over nothing in particular—such fights were beginning to happen among us all the time.</div>
<div class="tx">“Then there was an old guy, a widower with no family, who had one hobby: phonograph records. I guess that was all he ever got out of life. In the old days, he used to skip meals just to buy himself some new recording of classical music. Well, they didn’t give him any ‘allowance’ for records—’.personal luxury,‘. they called it. But at that same meeting, Millie Bush, somebody’s daughter, a mean, ugly little eight-year-old, was voted a pair of gold braces for her buck teeth— this was ’.medical need,.‘. because the staff psychologist had said that the poor girl would get an inferiority complex if her teeth weren’t straightened out. The old guy who loved music, turned to drink, instead. He got so you never saw him fully conscious any more. But it seems like there was one thing he couldn’t forget. One night, he came staggering down the street, saw Millie Bush, swung his fist and knocked all her teeth out. Every one of them.</div>
<div class="tx">“Drink, of course, was what we all turned to, some more, some less. Don’t ask how we got the money for it. When all the decent pleasures are forbidden, there’s always ways to get the rotten ones. You don’t break into grocery stores after dark and you don’t pick your fellow’s pockets to buy classical symphonies or fishing tackle, but if it’s to get stinking drunk and forget—you do. Fishing tackle? Hunting guns? Snapshot cameras? Hobbies? There wasn’t any ‘amusement allowance’ for anybody. ’.Amusement’ was the first thing they dropped. Aren’t you always supposed to be ashamed to object when anybody asks you to give up anything, if it’s something that gave you pleasure? Even our ‘tobacco allowance’ was cut to where we got two packs of cigarettes a month—and this, they told us, was because the money had to go into the babies’ milk fund. Babies was the only item of production that didn’t fall, but rose and kept on rising—because people had nothing else to do, I guess, and because they didn’t have to care, the baby wasn’t their burden, it was ’.the family’s.‘. In fact, the best chance you had of getting a raise and breathing easier for a while was a ’.baby allowance..‘. Either that, or a major disease.</div>
<div class="tx">“It didn’t take us long to see how it all worked out. Any man who tried to play straight, had to refuse himself everything. He lost his taste for any pleasure, he hated to smoke a nickel’s worth of tobacco or chew a stick of gum, worrying whether somebody had more need for that nickel. He felt ashamed of every mouthful of food he swallowed, wondering whose weary nights of overtime had paid for it, knowing that his food was not his by right, miserably wishing to be cheated rather than to cheat, to be a sucker, but not a blood-sucker. He wouldn’t marry, he wouldn’t help his folks back home, he wouldn’t put an extra burden on ‘the family.’ Besides, if he still had some sort of sense of responsibility, he couldn’t marry or bring children into the world, when he could plan nothing, promise nothing, count on nothing. But the shiftless and the irresponsible had a field day of it. They bred babies, they got girls into trouble, they dragged in every worthless relative they had from all over the country, every unmarried pregnant sister, for an extra ‘disability allowance,’ they got more sicknesses than any doctor could disprove, they ruined their clothing, their furniture, their homes—what the hell, ‘the family’ was paying for it! They found more ways of getting in ’.need’ than the rest of us could ever imagine -they developed a special skill for it, which was the only ability they showed.</div>
<div class="tx">“God help us, ma.‘am! Do you see what we saw? We saw that we’d been given a law to live by, a <i>moral</i> law, they called it, which punished those who observed it—for observing it. The more you tried to live up to it, the more you suffered; the more you cheated it, the bigger reward you got. Your honesty was like a tool left at the mercy of the next man’s dishonesty. The honest ones paid, the dishonest collected. The honest lost, the dishonest won. How long could men stay good under this sort of a law of goodness? We were a pretty decent bunch of fellows when we started. There weren’t many chiselers among us. We knew our jobs and we were proud of it and we worked for the best factory in the country, where old man Starnes hired nothing but the pick of the country’s labor. Within one year under the new plan, there wasn’t an honest man left among us. <i>That</i> was the evil, the sort of hell-horror evil that preachers used to scare you with, but you never thought to see alive. Not that the plan encouraged a few bastards, but that it turned decent people into bastards, and there was nothing else that it could do—and it was called a moral ideal!</div>
<div class="tx">“What was it we were supposed to want to work for? For the love of our brothers? What brothers? For the bums, the loafers, the moochers we saw all around us? And whether they were cheating or plain incompetent, whether they were unwilling or unable—what difference did that make to us? If we were tied for life to the level of their unfitness, faked or real, how long could we care to go on? We had no way of knowing their ability, we had no way of controlling their needs—all we knew was that we were beasts of burden struggling blindly in some sort of place that was half-hospital, half-stockyards—a place geared to nothing but disability, disaster, disease—beasts put there for the relief of whatever whoever chose to say was whichever’s need.</div>
<div class="tx">“Love of our brothers? That’s when we learned to hate our brothers for the first time in our lives. We began to hate them for every meal they swallowed, for every small pleasure they enjoyed, for one man’s new shirt, for another’s wife’s hat, for an outing with their family, for a paint job on their house—it was taken from us, it was paid for by our privations, our denials, our hunger. We began to spy on one another, each hoping to catch the others lying about their needs, so as to cut their .‘allowance’ at the next meeting. We began to have stool pigeons who informed on people, who reported that somebody had bootlegged a turkey to his family on some Sunday—which he’d paid for by gambling, most likely. We began to meddle into one another’s lives. We provoked family quarrels, to get somebody’s relatives thrown out. Any time we saw a man starting to go steady with a girl, we made life miserable for him. We broke up many engagements. We didn’t want anyone to marry, we didn’t want any more dependents to feed.</div>
<div class="tx">“In the old days, we used to celebrate if somebody had a baby, we used to chip in and help him out with the hospital bills, if he happened to be hard-pressed for the moment. Now, if a baby was born, we didn’t speak to the parents for weeks. Babies, to us, had become what locusts were to farmers. In the old days, we used to help a man if he had a bad illness in the family. Now—well, I’ll tell you about just one case. It was the mother of a man who had been with us for fifteen years. She was a kindly old lady, cheerful and wise, she knew us all by our first names and we all liked her—we used to like her. One day, she slipped on the cellar stairs and fell and broke her hip. We knew what that meant at her age. The staff doctor said that she’d have to be sent to a hospital in town, for expensive treatments that would take a long time. The old lady died the night before she was to leave for town. They never established the cause of death. No, I don’t know whether she was murdered. Nobody said that. Nobody would talk about it at all. All I know is that I—and that’s what I can’t forget!—I, too, had caught myself wishing that she would die. This—may God forgive us!—was the brotherhood, the security, the abundance that the plan was supposed to achieve for us!</div>
<div class="tx">“Was there any reason why this sort of horror would ever be preached by anybody? Was there anybody who got any profit from it? There was. The Starnes heirs. I hope you’re not going to remind me that they’d sacrificed a fortune and turned the factory over to us as a gift. We were fooled by that one, too. Yes, they gave up the factory. But profit, ma.‘am, depends on what it is you’re after. And what the Starnes heirs were after, no money on earth could buy. Money is too clean and innocent for that.</div>
<div class="tx">“Eric Starnes, the youngest—he was a jellyfish that didn’t have the guts to be after anything in particular. He got himself voted as Director of our Public Relations Department, which didn’t do anything, except that he had a staff for the not doing of anything, so he didn’t have to bother sticking around the office. The pay he got—well, I shouldn’t call it ‘pay,’ none of us was ‘paid’.—the alms voted to him was fairly modest, about ten times what I got, but that wasn’t riches. Eric didn’t care for money—he wouldn’t have known what to do with it. He spent his time hanging around among us, showing how chummy he was and democratic. He wanted to be loved, it seems. The way he went about it was to keep reminding us that he had given us the factory. We couldn’t stand him.</div>
<div class="tx">“Gerald Starnes was our Director of Production. We never learned just what the size of his rake-off-his alms—had been. It would have taken a staff of accountants to figure that out, and a staff of engineers to trace the way it was piped, directly or indirectly, into his office. None of it was supposed to be for him—it was all for company expenses. Gerald had three cars, four secretaries, five telephones, and he used to throw champagne and caviar parties that no tax-paying tycoon in the country could have afforded. He spent more money in  one year than his father had earned in profits in the last two years of his life. We saw a hundred-pound stack—a hundred pounds, we weighed them—of magazines in Gerald’s office, full of stories about our factory and our noble plan, with big pictures of Gerald Starnes, calling him a great social crusader. Gerald liked to come into the shops at night, dressed in his formal clothes, flashing diamond cuff links the size of a nickel and shaking cigar ashes all over. Any cheap show-off who’s got nothing to parade but his cash, is bad enough—except that he makes no bones about the cash being his, and you’re free to gape at him or not, as you wish, and mostly you don’t. But when a bastard like Gerald Starnes puts on an act and keeps spouting that he doesn’t care for material wealth, that he’s only serving ‘the family,’ that all the lushness is not for himself, but for our sake and for the common good, because it’s necessary to keep up the prestige of the company and of the noble plan in the eyes of the public—then that’s when you learn to hate the creature as you’ve never hated anything human.</div>
<div class="tx">“But his sister Ivy was worse. She really did not care for material wealth. The alms she got was no bigger than ours, and she went about in scuffed, flat-heeled shoes and shirtwaists—just to show how selfless she was. She was our Director of Distribution. She was the lady in charge of our needs. She was the one who held us by the throat. Of course, distribution was supposed to be decided by voting—by the voice of the people. But when the people are six thousand howling voices, trying to decide without yardstick, rhyme or reason, when there are no rules to the game and each can demand anything, but has a right to nothing, when everybody holds power over everybody’s life except his own—then it turns out, as it did, that the voice of the people is Ivy Starnes. By the end of the second year, we dropped the pretense of the ‘family meetings’.—in the name of ‘production efficiency and time economy,’ one meeting used to take ten days—and all the petitions of need were simply sent to Miss Starnes’ office. No, not sent. They had to be recited to her in person by every petitioner. Then she made up a distribution list, which she read to us for our vote of approval at a meeting that lasted three-quarters of an hour. We voted approval. There was a ten-minute period on the agenda for discussion and objections. We made no objections. We knew better by that time. Nobody can divide a factory’s income among thousands of people, without some sort of a gauge to measure people’s value. Her gauge was bootlicking. Selfless? In her father’s time, all of his money wouldn’t have given him a chance to speak to his lousiest wiper and get away with it, as she spoke to our best skilled workers and their wives. She had pale eyes that looked fishy, cold and dead. And if you ever want to see pure evil, you should have seen the way her eyes glinted when she watched some man who’d talked back to her once and who’d just heard his name on the list of those getting nothing  above basic pittance. And when you saw it, you saw the real motive of any person who’s ever preached the slogan: ‘From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.’</div>
<div class="tx">“This was the whole secret of it. At first, I kept wondering how it could be possible that the educated, the cultured, the famous men of the world could make a mistake of this size and preach, as righteousness, this sort of abomination—when five minutes of thought should have told them what would happen if somebody tried to practice what they preached. Now I know that they didn’t do it by any kind of mistake. Mistakes of this size are never made innocently. If men fall for some vicious piece of insanity, when they have no way to make it work and no possible reason to explain their choice—it’s because they have a reason that they do not wish to tell. And we weren’t so innocent either, when we voted for that plan at the first meeting. We didn’t do it just because we believed that the drippy old guff they spewed was good. We had another reason, but the guff helped us to hide it from our neighbors and from ourselves. The guff gave us a chance to pass off as virtue something that we’d be ashamed to admit otherwise. There wasn’t a man voting for it who didn’t think that under a setup of this kind he’d muscle in on the profits of the men abler than himself. There wasn’t a man rich and smart enough but that he didn’t think that somebody was richer and smarter, and this plan would give him a share of his better’s wealth and brain. But while he was thinking that he’d get unearned benefits from the men above, he forgot about the men below who’d get unearned benefits, too. He forgot about all his inferiors who’d rush to drain him just as he hoped to drain his superiors. The worker who liked the idea that his need entitled him to a limousine like his boss.‘s, forgot that every bum and beggar on earth would come howling that <i>their</i> need entitled them to an icebox like his own. <i>That</i> was our real motive when we voted—that was the truth of it—but we didn’t like to think it, so the less we liked it, the louder we yelled about our love for the common good.</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, we got what we asked for. By the time we saw what it was that we’d asked for, it was too late. We were trapped, with no place to go. The best men among us left the factory in the first week of the plan. We lost our best engineers, superintendents, foremen and highest-skilled workers. A man of self-respect doesn’t turn into a milch cow for anybody. Some able fellows tried to stick it out, but they couldn’t take it for long. We kept losing our men, they kept escaping from the factory like from a pesthole—till we had nothing left except the men of need, but none of the men of ability.</div>
<div class="tx">“And the few of us who were still any good, but stayed on, were only those who had been there too long. In the old days, nobody ever quit the Twentieth Century—and, somehow, we couldn’t make ourselves believe that it was gone. After a while, we couldn’t quit, because no other employer would have us—for which I can’t blame him.  Nobody would deal with us in any way, no respectable person or firm. All the small shops, where we traded, started moving out of Starnesville fast—till we had nothing left but saloons, gambling joints and crooks who sold us trash at gouging prices. The alms we got kept falling, but the cost of our living went up. The list of the factory’s needy kept stretching, but the list of its customers shrank. There was less and less income to divide among more and more people. In the old days, it used to be said that the Twentieth Century Motor trademark was as good as the karat mark on gold. I don’t know what it was that the Starnes heirs thought, if they thought at all, but I suppose that like all social planners and like savages, they thought that this trademark was a magic stamp which did the trick by some sort of voodoo power and that it would keep them rich, as it had kept their father. Well, when our customers began to see that we never delivered an order on time and never put out a motor that didn’t have something wrong with it—the magic stamp began to work the other way around: people wouldn’t take a motor as a gift, if it was marked Twentieth Century. And it came to where our only customers were men who never paid and never meant to pay their bills. But Gerald Starnes, doped by his own publicity, got huffy and went around, with an air of moral superiority, demanding that businessmen place orders with us, not because our motors were good, but because we <i>needed</i>  the orders so badly.</div>
<div class="tx">“By that time, a village half-wit could see what generations of professors had pretended not to notice. What good would our need do to a power plant when its generators stopped because of our defective engines? What good would it do to a man caught on an operating table when the electric light went out? What good would it do to the passengers of a plane when its motor failed in mid-air? And if they bought our product, not because of its merit, but because of our need, would that be the good, the right, the moral thing to do for the owner of that power plant, the surgeon in that hospital, the maker of that plane?</div>
<div class="tx">“Yet this was the moral law that the professors and leaders and thinkers had wanted to establish all over the earth. If this is what it did in a single small town where we all knew one another, do you care to think what it would do on a world scale? Do you care to imagine what it would be like, if you had to live and to work, when you’re tied to all the disasters and all the malingering of the globe? To work -and whenever any men failed anywhere, it’s you who would have to make up for it. To work—with no chance to rise, with your meals and your clothes and your home and your pleasure depending on any swindle, any famine, any pestilence anywhere on earth. To work-with no chance for an extra ration, till the Cambodians have been fed and the Patagonians have been sent through college. To work—on a blank check held by every creature born, by men whom you’ll never  see, whose needs you’ll never know, whose ability or laziness or sloppiness or fraud you have no way to learn and no right to question -just to work and work and work—and leave it up to the Ivys and the Geralds of the world to decide whose stomach will consume the effort, the dreams and the days of your life. And <i>this</i> is the moral law to accept? <i>This—a</i> moral ideal?</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, we tried it—and we learned. Our agony took four years, from our first meeting to our last, and it ended the only way it could end: in bankruptcy. At our last meeting, Ivy Starnes was the one who tried to brazen it out. She made a short, nasty, snippy little speech in which she said that the plan had failed because the rest of the country had not accepted it, that a single community could not succeed in the midst of a selfish, greedy world—and that the plan was a noble ideal, but human nature was not good enough for it. A young boy—the one who had been punished for giving us a useful idea in our first year—got up, as we all sat silent, and walked straight to Ivy Starnes on the platform. He said nothing. He spat in her face. That was the end of the noble plan and of the Twentieth Century.”</div>
<div class="tx">The man had spoken as if the burden of his years of silence had slipped suddenly out of his grasp. She knew that this was his tribute to her: he had shown no reaction to her kindness, he had seemed numbed to human value or human hope, but something within him had been reached and his response was this confession, this long, desperate cry of rebellion against injustice, held back for years, but breaking out in recognition of the first person he had met in whose hearing an appeal for justice would not be hopeless. It was as if the life he had been about to renounce were given back to him by the two essentials he needed: by his food and by the presence of a rational being.</div>
<div class="tx">“But what about John Galt?” she asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh ...” he said, remembering. “Oh, yes ...”</div>
<div class="tx">“You were going to tell me why people started asking that question.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes ...” He was looking off, as if at some sight which he had studied for years, but which remained unchanged and unsolved; his face had an odd, questioning look of terror.</div>
<div class="tx">“You were going to tell me who was the John Galt they mean—if there ever was such a person.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I hope there wasn‘t, ma’.am. I mean, I hope that it’s just a coincidence, just a sentence that hasn’t any meaning.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You had something in mind. What?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It was ... it was something that happened at that first meeting at the Twentieth Century factory. Maybe that was the start of it, maybe not. I don’t know ... The meeting was held on a spring night, twelve years ago. The six thousand of us were crowded on bleachers built way up to the rafters of the plant’s largest hangar. We had just voted for the new plan and we were in an edgy sort of mood, making too much  noise, cheering the people’s victory, threatening some kind of unknown enemies and spoiling for a fight, like bullies with an uneasy conscience. There were white arclights beating down on us and we felt kind of touchy and raw, and we were an ugly, dangerous mob in that moment. Gerald Starnes, who was chairman, kept hammering his gavel for order, and we quieted down some, but not much, and you could see the whole place moving restlessly from side to side, like water in a pan that’s being rocked. ‘This is a crucial moment in the history of mankind!’ Gerald Starnes yelled through the noise. ‘Remember that none of us may now leave this place, for each of us belongs to all the others by the moral law which we all accept!’ ‘I don’.t,‘. said one man and stood up. He was one of the young engineers. Nobody knew much about him. He’d always kept mostly by himself. When he stood up, we suddenly turned dead-still. It was the way he held his head. He was tall and slim—and I remember thinking that any two of us could have broken his neck without trouble—but what we all felt was fear. He stood like a man who knew that he was right. ’.I will put an end to this, once and for all,‘. he said. His voice was clear and without any feeling. That was all he said and started to walk out. He walked down the length of the place, in the white light, not hurrying and not noticing any of us. Nobody moved to stop him. Gerald Starnes cried suddenly after him, ’.How?‘. He turned and answered, ’.I will stop the motor of the world..‘. Then he walked out. We never saw him again. We never heard what became of him. But years later, when we saw the lights going out, one after another, in the great factories that had stood solid like mountains for generations, when we saw the gates closing and the conveyor belts turning still, when we saw the roads growing empty and the stream of cars draining off, when it began to look as if some silent power were stopping the generators of the world and the world was crumbling quietly, like a body when its spirit is gone—then we began to wonder and to ask questions about him. We began to ask it of one another, those of us who had heard him say it. We began to think that he had kept his word, that he, who had seen and known the truth we refused to know, was the retribution we had called upon our heads, the avenger, the man of that justice which we had defied. We began to think that he had damned us and there was no escape from his verdict and we would never be able to get away from him—and this was the more terrible because he was not pursuing us, it was we who were suddenly looking for him and he had merely gone without a trace. We found no answer about him anywhere. We wondered by what sort of impossible power he could have done what he had promised to do. There was no answer to that. We began to think of him whenever we saw another collapse in the world, which nobody could explain, whenever we took another blow, whenever we lost another hope, whenever we felt caught in this dead, gray fog that’s descending all over the earth. Perhaps people heard us crying that  question and they did not know what we meant, but they knew too well the feeling that made us cry it. They, too, felt that something had gone from the world. Perhaps this was why they began to say it, whenever they felt that there was no hope. I’d like to think that I am wrong, that those words mean nothing, that there’s no conscious intention and no avenger behind the ending of the human race. But when I hear them repeating that question, I feel afraid. I think of the man who said that he would stop the motor of the world. You see, his name was John Galt.”</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="066" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_066_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">She awakened, because the sound of the wheels had changed. It was an irregular beat, with sudden screeches and short, sharp cracks, a sound like the broken laughter of hysteria, with the fitful jerking of the car to match it. She knew, before she glanced at her watch, that this was the track of the Kansas Western and that the train had started on its long detour south from Kirby, Nebraska.</div>
<div class="tx">The train was half-empty; few people had ventured across the continent on the first Comet since the tunnel disaster. She had given a bedroom to the tramp, and then had remained alone with his story. She had wanted to think of it, of all the questions she intended to ask him tomorrow—but she had found her mind frozen and still, like a spectator staring at the story, unable to function, only to stare. She had felt as if she knew the meaning of that spectacle, knew it with no further questions and had to escape it. To move—had been the words beating in her mind with peculiar urgency—to move—as if movement had become an end in itself, crucial, absolute and doomed.</div>
<div class="tx">Through a thin layer of sleep, the sound of the wheels had kept running a race with the growth of her tension. She had kept awakening, as in a causeless start of panic, finding herself upright in the darkness, thinking blankly: What was it?—then telling herself in reassurance : We’re moving ... we’re still moving....</div>
<div class="tx">The track of the Kansas Western was worse than she had expected—she thought, listening to the wheels. The train was now carrying her hundreds of miles away from Utah. She had felt a desperate desire to get off the train on the main line, abandon all the problems of Taggart Transcontinental, find an airplane and fly straight to Quentin Daniels. It had taken a cheerless effort of will to remain in her car.</div>
<div class="tx">She lay in the darkness, listening to the wheels, thinking that only Daniels and his motor still remained like a point of fire ahead, pulling her forward. Of what use would the motor now be to her? She had no answer. Why did she feel so certain of the desperate need to hurry? She had no answer. To reach him in time, was the only ultimatum left in her mind. She held onto it, asking no questions. Wordlessly, she knew the real answer: the motor was needed, not to move trains, but to keep her moving.</div>
<div class="tx">She could not hear the beat of the fourth knocks any longer in the jumbled screeching of metal, she could not hear the steps of the enemy she was racing, only the hopeless stampede of panic.... I’ll get there in time, she thought, I’ll get there first, I’ll save the motor.  <i>There’s</i> one motor he’s not going to stop, she thought ... he’s not going to stop ... he’s not going to stop ... He’s not going to stop, she thought—awakening with a jolt, jerking her head off the pillow. The wheels had stopped.</div>
<div class="tx">For a moment, she remained still, trying to grasp the peculiar stillness around her. It felt like the impossible attempt to create a sensory image of non-existence. There were no attributes of reality to perceive, nothing but their absence: no sound, as if she were alone on the train—no motion, as if this were not a train, but a room in a building—no light, as if this were neither train nor room, but space without objects—no sign of violence or physical disaster, as if this were the state where disaster is no longer possible.</div>
<div class="tx">In the moment when she grasped the nature of the stillness, her body sprang upright with a single curve of motion, immediate and violent like a cry of rebellion. The loud screech of the window shade went like a knife-cut through the silence, as she threw the shade upward. There was nothing outside but anonymous stretches of prairie; a strong wind was breaking the clouds, and a shaft of moonlight fell through, but it fell upon plains that seemed as dead as those from which it came.</div>
<div class="tx">The sweep of her hand pressed the light switch and the bell to summon the porter. The electric light came on and brought her back to a rational world. She glanced at her watch: it was a few minutes past midnight. She looked out of the rear window: the track went off in a straight line and, at the prescribed distance, she saw the red lanterns left on the ground, placed conscientiously to protect the rear of the train. The sight seemed reassuring.</div>
<div class="tx">She pressed the porter’s bell once more. She waited. She went to the vestibule, unlocked the door and leaned out to look down the line of the train. A few windows were lighted in the long, tapering band of steel, but she saw no figures, no sign of human activity. She slammed the door, came back and started to dress, her movements suddenly calm and swift.</div>
<div class="tx">No one came to answer her bell. When she hastened across to the next car, she felt no fear, no uncertainty, no despair, nothing but the urgency of action.</div>
<div class="tx">There was no porter in the cubbyhole of the next car, no porter in the car beyond. She hurried down the narrow passageways, meeting no one. But a few compartment doors were open. The passengers sat inside, dressed or half-dressed, silently, as if waiting. They watched her rush by with oddly furtive glances, as if they knew what she was after, as if they had expected someone to come and to face what they  had not faced. She went on, running down the spinal cord of a dead train, noting the peculiar combination of lighted compartments, open doors and empty passages: no one had ventured to step out. No one had wanted to ask the first question.</div>
<div class="tx">She ran through the train’s only coach, where some passengers slept in contorted poses of exhaustion, while others, awake and still, sat hunched, like animals waiting for a blow, making no move to avert it.</div>
<div class="tx">In the vestibule of the coach, she stopped. She saw a man, who had unlocked the door and was leaning out, looking inquiringly ahead through the darkness, ready to step off. He turned at the sound of her approach. She recognized his face: it was Owen Kellogg, the man who had rejected the future she had once offered him.</div>
<div class="tx">“Kellogg!” she gasped, the sound of laughter in her voice like a cry of relief at the sudden sight of a man in a desert.</div>
<div class="tx">“Hello, Miss Taggart,” he answered, with an astonished smile that held a touch of incredulous pleasure—and of wistfulness. “I didn’t know you were aboard.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Come on,” she ordered, as if he were still an employee of the railroad. “I think we’re on a frozen train.”</div>
<div class="tx">“We are,” he said, and followed her with prompt, disciplined obedience.</div>
<div class="tx">No explanations were necessary. It was as if, in unspoken understanding, they were answering a call to duty—and it seemed natural that of the hundreds aboard, it was the two of them who should be partners-in-danger.</div>
<div class="tx">“Any idea how long we’ve been standing?” she asked, as they hurried on through the next car.</div>
<div class="tx">“No,” he said. “We were standing when I woke up.”</div>
<div class="tx">They went the length of the train, finding no porters, no waiters in the diner, no brakemen, no conductor. They glanced at each other once in a while, but kept silent. They knew the stories of abandoned trains, of the crews that vanished in sudden bursts of rebellion against serfdom.</div>
<div class="tx">They got off at the head end of the train, with no motion around them save the wind on their faces, and they climbed swiftly aboard the engine. The engine’s headlight was on, stretching like an accusing arm into the void of the night. The engine’s cab was empty.</div>
<div class="tx">Her cry of desperate triumph broke out in answer to the shock of the sight: “Good for them! They’re human beings!”</div>
<div class="tx">She stopped, aghast, as at the cry of a stranger. She noticed that Kellogg stood watching her curiously, with the faint hint of a smile.</div>
<div class="tx">It was an old steam engine, the best that the railroad had been able to provide for the Comet. The fire was banked in the grates, the steam gauge was low, and in the great windshield before them the headlight fell upon a band of ties that should have been running to meet  them, but lay still instead, like a ladder’s steps, counted, numbered and ended.</div>
<div class="tx">She reached for the logbook and looked at the names of the train’s last crew. The engineer had been Pat Logan.</div>
<div class="tx">Her head dropped slowly, and she closed her eyes. She thought of the first run on a green-blue track, that must have been in Pat Logan’s mind—as it was now in hers—through the silent hours of his last run on any rail.</div>
<div class="tx">“Miss Taggart?” said Owen Kellogg softly.</div>
<div class="tx">She jerked her head up. “Yes,” she said, “yes ... Well”—her voice had no color except the metallic tinge of decision—“we’ll have to get to a phone and call for another crew.” She glanced at her watch. “At the rate we were running, I think we must be about eighty miles from the Oklahoma state line. I believe Bradshaw is this road’s nearest division point to call. We’re somewhere within thirty miles of it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Are there any Taggart trains following us?”</div>
<div class="tx">“The next one is Number 253, the transcontinental freight, but it won’t get here till about seven A.M., if it’s running on time, which I doubt.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Only <i>one</i> freight in seven hours?” He said it involuntarily, with a note of outraged loyalty to the great railroad he had once been proud .to serve.</div>
<div class="tx">Her mouth moved in the brief snap of a smile. “Our transcontinental traffic is not what it was in your day.”</div>
<div class="tx">He nodded slowly. “I don’t suppose there are any Kansas Western trains coming tonight, either?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I can’t remember offhand, but I think not.”</div>
<div class="tx">He glanced at the poles by the side of the track. “I hope that the Kansas Western people have kept their phones in order.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You mean that the chances are they haven.‘t, if we judge by the state of their track. But we’ll have to try it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">She turned to go, but stopped. She knew it was useless to comment, but the words came involuntarily. “You know,” she said, “it’s those lanterns our men put behind the train to protect us that’s the hardest thing to take. They ... they felt more concern for human lives than their country had shown for theirs.”</div>
<div class="tx">His swift glance at her was like a shot of deliberate emphasis, then he answered gravely, “Yes, Miss Taggart.”</div>
<div class="tx">Climbing down the ladder on the side of the engine, they saw a cluster of passengers gathered by the track and more figures emerging from the train to join them. By some special instinct of their own, the men who had sat waiting knew that someone had taken charge, someone had assumed the responsibility and it was now safe to show signs of life.</div>
<div class="tx">They all looked at her with an air of inquiring expectation, as she approached. The unnatural pallor of the moonlight seemed to dissolve the differences of their faces and to stress the quality they all had in common: a look of cautious appraisal, part fear, part plea, part impertinence held in abeyance.</div>
<div class="tx">“Is there anyone here who wishes to be spokesman for the passengers?” she asked.</div>
<div class="tx">They looked at one another. There was no answer.</div>
<div class="tx">“Very well,” she said. “You don’t have to speak. I’m Dagny Taggart, the Operating Vice-President of this railroad, and”—there was a rustle of response from the group, half-movement, half-whisper, resembling relief—“and I’ll do the speaking. We are on a train that has been abandoned by its crew. There was no physical accident. The engine is intact. But there is no one to run it. This is what the newspapers call a frozen train. You all know what it means—and you know the reasons. Perhaps you knew the reasons long before they were discovered by the men who deserted you tonight. The law forbade them to desert. But this will not help you now.”</div>
<div class="tx">A woman shrieked suddenly, with the demanding petulance of hysteria, “What are we going to do?”</div>
<div class="tx">Dagny paused to look at her. The woman was pushing forward, to squeeze herself into the group, to place some human bodies between herself and the sight of the great vacuum—the plain stretching off and dissolving into moonlight, the dead phosphorescence of impotent, borrowed energy. The woman had a coat thrown over a nightgown; the coat was slipping open and her stomach protruded under the gown’s thin cloth, with that loose obscenity of manner which assumes all human self-revelation to be ugliness and makes no effort to conceal it. For a moment, Dagny regretted the necessity to continue.</div>
<div class="tx">“I shall go down the track to a telephone,” she continued, her voice clear and as cold as the moonlight. “There are emergency telephones at intervals of five miles along the right-of-way. I shall call for another crew to be sent here. This will take some time. You will please stay aboard and maintain such order as you are capable of maintaining.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What about the gangs of raiders?” asked another woman’s nervous voice.</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s true,” said Dagny. “I’d better have someone to accompany me. Who wishes to go?”</div>
<div class="tx">She had misunderstood the woman’s motive. There was no answer. There were no glances directed at her or at one another. There were no eyes—only moist ovals glistening in the moonlight. There they were, she thought, the men of the new age, the demanders and recipients of self-sacrifice. She was struck by a quality of anger in their silence—an anger saying that she was supposed to spare them moments such  as this—and, with a feeling of cruelty new to her, she remained silent by conscious intention.</div>
<div class="tx">She noticed that Owen Kellogg, too, was waiting; but he was not watching the passengers, he was watching her face. When he became certain that there would be no answer from the crowd, he said quietly, “I’ll go with you, of course, Miss Taggart.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Thank you.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What about us?” snapped the nervous woman.</div>
<div class="tx">Dagny turned to her, answering in the formal, inflectionless monotone of a business executive, “There have been no cases of raider gang attacks upon frozen trains—unfortunately.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Just where are we?” asked a bulky man with too expensive an overcoat and too flabby a face; his voice had a tone intended for servants by a man unfit to employ them. “In what part of what state?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know,” she answered.</div>
<div class="tx">“How long will we be kept here?” asked another, in the tone of a creditor who is imposed upon by a debtor.</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know.”</div>
<div class="tx">“When will we get to San Francisco?” asked a third, in the manner of a sheriff addressing a suspect.</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know.”</div>
<div class="tx">The demanding resentment was breaking loose, in small, crackling puffs, like chestnuts popping open in the dark oven of the minds who now felt certain that they were taken care of and safe.</div>
<div class="tx">“This is perfectly outrageous!” yelled a woman, springing forward, throwing her words at Dagny’s face. “You have no right to let this happen! I don’t intend to be kept waiting in the middle of nowhere! I expect transportation!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Keep your mouth shut,” said Dagny, “or I’ll lock the train doors and leave you where you are.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You can’t do that! You’re a common carrier! You have no right to discriminate against me! I’ll report it to the Unification Board!”</div>
<div class="tx">“—if I give you a train to get you within sight or hearing of your Board,” said Dagny, turning away.</div>
<div class="tx">She saw Kellogg looking at her, his glance like a line drawn under her words, underscoring them for her own attention.</div>
<div class="tx">“Get a flashlight somewhere,” she said, “while I go to get my handbag, then we’ll start.”</div>
<div class="tx">When they started out on their way to the track phone, walking past the silent line of cars, they saw another figure descending from the train and hurrying to meet them. She recognized the tramp.</div>
<div class="tx">“Trouble, ma.‘am?” he asked, stopping.</div>
<div class="tx">“The crew has deserted.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh. What’s to be done?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m going to a phone to call the division point.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You can’t go alone, ma.‘am. Not these days. I’d better go with you.”</div>
<div class="tx">She smiled. “Thanks. But I’ll be all right. Mr. Kellogg here is going with me. Say-what’s your name?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Jeff Allen, ma.‘am.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Listen, Allen, have you ever worked for a railroad?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, ma.‘am.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, you’re working for one now. You’re deputy-conductor and proxy-vice-president-in-charge-of-operation. Your job is to take charge of this train in my absence, to preserve order and to keep the cattle from stampeding. Tell them that I appointed you. You don’t need any proof. They’ll obey anybody who expects obedience.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, ma.‘am,” he answered firmly, with a look of understanding.</div>
<div class="tx">She remembered that money inside a man’s pocket had the power to turn into confidence inside his mind; she took a hundred-dollar bill from her bag and slipped it into his hand. “As advance on wages,” she said.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, ma.‘am.”</div>
<div class="tx">She had started off, when he called after her, “Miss Taggart!”</div>
<div class="tx">She turned. “Yes?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Thank you,” he said.</div>
<div class="tx">She smiled, half-raising her hand in a parting salute, and walked .on.</div>
<div class="tx">“Who is that?” asked Kellogg.</div>
<div class="tx">“A tramp who was caught stealing a ride.”</div>
<div class="tx">“He’ll do the job, I think.”</div>
<div class="tx">“He will.”</div>
<div class="tx">They walked silently past the engine and on in the direction of its headlight. At first, stepping from tie to tie, with the violent light beating against them from behind, they still felt as if they were at home in the normal realm of a railroad. Then she found herself watching the light on the ties under her feet, watching it ebb slowly, trying to hold it, to keep seeing its fading glow, until she knew that the hint of a glow on the wood was no longer anything but moonlight. She could not prevent the shudder that made her turn to look back. The headlight still hung behind them, like the liquid silver globe of a planet, deceptively close, but belonging to another orbit and another system.</div>
<div class="tx">Owen Kellogg walked silently beside her, and she felt certain that they knew each other’s thoughts.</div>
<div class="tx">“He couldn’t have. Oh God, he couldn.‘t!” she said suddenly, not realizing that she had switched to words.</div>
<div class="tx">.“Who?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Nathaniel Taggart. He couldn’t have worked with people like those passengers. He couldn’t have run trains for them. He couldn’t have  employed them. He couldn’t have used them at all, neither as customers nor as workers.”</div>
<div class="tx">Kellogg smiled. “You mean that he couldn’t have grown rich by exploiting them, Miss Taggart?”</div>
<div class="tx">She nodded. “They ...” she said, and he heard the faint trembling of her voice, which was love and pain and indignation, “they’ve said for years that he rose by thwarting the ability of others, by leaving them no chance, and that ... that human incompetence was to his selfish interest.... But he ... it wasn’t obedience that he required of people.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Miss Taggart,” he said, with an odd note of sternness in his voice, “just remember that he represented a code of existence which—for a brief span in all human history—drove slavery out of the civilized world. Remember it, when you feel baffled by the nature of his enemies.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Have you ever heard of a woman named Ivy Starnes?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I keep thinking that this was what she would have enjoyed—the spectacle of those passengers tonight. This was what she’s after. But we—we can’t live with it, you and I, can we? No one can live with it. It’s not possible to live with it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What makes you think that Ivy Starnes’s purpose is life?”</div>
<div class="tx">Somewhere on the edge of her mind—like the wisps she saw floating on the edges of the prairie, neither quite rays nor fog nor cloud—she felt some shape which she could not grasp, half-suggested and demanding to be grasped.</div>
<div class="tx">She did not speak, and—like the links of a chain unrolling through their silence—the rhythm of their steps went on, spaced to the ties, scored by the dry, swift beat of heels on wood.</div>
<div class="tx">She had not had time to be aware of him, except as of a providential comrade-in-competence; now she glanced at him with conscious attention. His face had the clear, hard look she remembered having liked in the past. But the face had grown calmer, as if more serenely at peace. His clothes were threadbare. He wore an old leather jacket, and even in the darkness she could distinguish the scuffed blotches streaking across the leather.</div>
<div class="tx">“What have you been doing since you left Taggart Transcontinental?” she asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, many things.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Where are you working now?”</div>
<div class="tx">“On special assignments, more or less.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Of what kind?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Of every kind.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re not working for a railroad?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No.”</div>
<div class="tx">The sharp brevity of the sound seemed to expand it into an eloquent statement. She knew that he knew her motive. “Kellogg, if I told you that I don’t have a single first-rate man left on the Taggart system, if I offered you any job, any terms, any money you cared to name—would you come back to us?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You were shocked by our loss of traffic. I don’t think you have any idea of what our loss of men has done to us. I can’t tell you the sort of agony I went through three days ago, trying to find somebody able to build five miles of temporary track. I have fifty miles to build through the Rockies. I see no way to do it. But it has to be done. I’ve combed the country for men. There aren’t any. And then to run into you suddenly, to find you here, in a day coach, when I’d give half the system for one employee like you—do you understand why I can’t let you go? Choose anything you wish. Want to be general manager of a region? Or assistant operating vice-president?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re still working for a living, aren’t you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You don’t seem to be making very much.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m making enough for my needs—and for nobody else’s.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why are you willing to work for anyone but Taggart Transcontinental?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Because you wouldn’t give me the kind of job I’d want.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I?” She stopped still. “Good God, Kellogg!—haven’t you understood? I’d give you any job you name!”</div>
<div class="tx">“All right. Track walker.”</div>
<div class="tx"><i>“What?”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“Section hand. Engine wiper.” He smiled at the look on her face. “No? You see, I said you wouldn’t.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you mean that you’d take a day laborer’s job?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Any time you offered it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But nothing better?”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s right, nothing better.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Don’t you understand that I have too many men who’re able to do those jobs, but nothing better?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I understand it, Miss Taggart. Do you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“What I need is your—”</div>
<div class="tx">“—mind, Miss Taggart? My mind is not on the market any longer.”</div>
<div class="tx">She stood looking at him, her face growing harder. “You’re one of them, aren’t you?” she said at last.</div>
<div class="tx">“Of whom?”</div>
<div class="tx">She did not answer, shrugged and went on.</div>
<div class="tx">“Miss Taggart,” he asked, “how long will you remain willing to be .<i>a common carrier?”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“I won’t surrender the world to the creature you’re quoting.”</div>
<div class="tx">“The answer you gave her was much more realistic.”</div>
<div class="tx">The chain of their steps had stretched through many silent minutes before she asked, “Why did you stand by me tonight? Why were you willing to help me?”</div>
<div class="tx">He answered easily, almost gaily, “Because there isn’t a passenger on that train who needs to get where he’s going more urgently than I do. If the train can be started, none will profit more than I. But when I need something, I don’t sit and expect transportation, like that creature of yours.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You don’t? And what if all trains stopped running?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then I wouldn’t count on making a crucial journey by train.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Where are you going?”</div>
<div class="tx">“West.”</div>
<div class="tx">“On a ‘special assignment’?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. For a month’s vacation with some friends.”</div>
<div class="tx">“A vacation? And it’s that important to you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“More important than anything on earth.”</div>
<div class="tx">They had walked two miles when they came to the small gray box on a post by the trackside, which was the emergency telephone. The box hung sidewise, beaten by storms. She jerked it open. The telephone was there, a familiar, reassuring object, glinting in the beam of Kellogg’s flashlight. But she knew, the moment she pressed the receiver to her ear, and he knew, when he saw her finger tapping sharply against the hook, that the telephone was dead.</div>
<div class="tx">She handed the receiver to him without a word. She held the flashlight, while he went swiftly over the instrument, then tore it off the wall and studied the wires.</div>
<div class="tx">“The wire’s okay,” he said. “The current’s on. It’s this particular instrument that’s out of order. There’s a chance that the next one might be working.” He added, “The next one is five miles away.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Let’s go,” she said.</div>
<div class="tx">Far behind them, the engine’s headlight was still visible, not a planet any longer, but a small star winking through mists of distance. Ahead of them, the rail went off into bluish space, with nothing to mark its end.</div>
<div class="tx">She realized how often she had glanced back at that headlight; so long as it remained in sight, she had felt as if a life-line were holding them anchored safely; now they had to break it and dive into ... and dive off this planet, she thought. She noticed that Kellogg, too, stood looking back at the headlight.</div>
<div class="tx">They glanced at each other, but said nothing. The crunch of a pebble under her shoe sole burst like a firecracker in the silence. With a coldly intentional movement, he kicked the telephone instrument and sent it rolling into a ditch: the violence of the noise shattered the vacuum.</div>
<div class="tx">“God damn him,” he said evenly, not raising his voice, with a  loathing past any display of emotion. “He probably didn’t feel like attending to his job, and since he <i>needed</i> his pay check, nobody had the right to ask that he keep the phones in order.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Come on,” she said.</div>
<div class="tx">“We can rest, if you feel tired, Miss Taggart.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m all right. We have no time to feel tired.”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s our great error, Miss Taggart. We ought to take the time, some day.”</div>
<div class="tx">She gave a brief chuckle, she stepped onto a tie of the track, stressing the step as her answer, and they went on.</div>
<div class="tx">It was hard, walking on ties, but when they tried to walk along the trackside, they found that it was harder. The soil, half-sand, half-dust, sank under their heels, like the soft, unresisting spread of some substance that was neither liquid nor solid. They went back to walking from tie to tie; it was almost like stepping from log to log in the midst of a river.</div>
<div class="tx">She thought of what an enormous distance five miles had suddenly become, and that a division point thirty miles away was now unattainable—after an era of railroads built by men who thought in thousands of transcontinental miles. That net of rails and lights, spreading from ocean to ocean, hung on the snap of a wire, on a broken connection inside a rusty phone—no, she thought, on something much more powerful and much more delicate. It hung on the connections in the minds of the men who knew that the existence of a wire, of a train, of a job, of themselves and their actions was an absolute not to be escaped. When such minds were gone, a two-thousand-ton train was left at the mercy of the muscles of her legs.</div>
<div class="tx">Tired?—she thought; even the strain of walking was a value, a small piece of reality in the stillness around them. The sensation of effort was a specific experience, it was pain and could be nothing else—in the midst of a space which was neither light nor dark, a soil which neither gave nor resisted, a fog which neither moved nor hung still. Their strain was the only evidence of their motion: nothing changed in the emptiness around them, nothing took form to mark their progress. She had always wondered, in incredulous contempt, about the sects that preached the annihilation of the universe as the ideal to be attained. <i>There,</i> she thought, was their world and the content of their minds made real.</div>
<div class="tx">When the green light of a signal appeared by the track, it gave them a point to reach and pass, but—incongruous in the midst of the floating dissolution—it brought them no sense of relief. It seemed to come from a long since extinguished world, like those stars whose light remains after they are gone. The green circle glowed in space, announcing a clear track, inviting motion where there was nothing to move. Who was that philosopher, she thought, who preached that motion exists without any moving entities? This was <i>his</i> world, too.</div>
<div class="tx">She found herself pushing forward with increasing effort, as if against some resistance that was, not pressure, but suction. Glancing at Kellogg, she saw that he, too, was walking like a man braced against a storm. She felt as if the two of them were the sole survivors of ... of reality, she thought—two lonely figures fighting, not through a storm, but worse: through non-existence.</div>
<div class="tx">It was Kellogg who glanced back, after a while, and she followed his glance: there was no headlight behind them.</div>
<div class="tx">They did not stop. Looking straight ahead, he reached absently into his pocket; she felt certain that the movement was involuntary; he produced a package of cigarettes and extended it to her.</div>
<div class="tx">She was about to take a cigarette—then, suddenly, she seized his wrist and tore the package out of his hand. It was a plain white package that bore, as single imprint, the sign of the dollar.</div>
<div class="tx">“Give me the flashlight!” she ordered, stopping.</div>
<div class="tx">He stopped obediently and sent the beam of the flashlight at the package in her hands. She caught a glimpse of his face: he looked a little astonished and very amused.</div>
<div class="tx">There was no printing on the package, no trade name, no address, only the dollar sign stamped in gold. The cigarettes bore the same sign.</div>
<div class="tx">“Where did you get this?” she asked.</div>
<div class="tx">He was smiling. “If you know enough to ask that, Miss Taggart, you should know that I won’t answer.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I know that this stands for something.”</div>
<div class="tx">“The dollar sign? For a great deal. It stands on the vest of every fat, piglike figure in every cartoon, for the purpose of denoting a crook, a grafter, a scoundrel—as the one sure-fire brand of evil. It stands—as the money of a free country—for achievement, for success, for ability, for man’s creative power—and, precisely for these reasons, it is used as a brand of infamy. It stands stamped on the forehead of a man like Hank Rearden, as a mark of damnation. Incidentally, do you know where that sign comes from? It stands for the initials of the United States.”</div>
<div class="tx">He snapped the flashlight off, but he did not move to go; she could distinguish the hint of his bitter smile.</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you know that the United States is the only country in history that has ever used its own monogram as a symbol of depravity? Ask yourself why. Ask yourself how long a country that did that could hope to exist, and whose moral standards have destroyed it. It was the only country in history where wealth was not acquired by looting, but by production, not by force, but by trade, the only country whose money was the symbol of man’s right to his own mind, to his work, to his life, to his happiness, to himself. If this is evil, by the present standards of the world, if this is the reason for damning us, then we —we, the dollar chasers and makers—accept it and choose to be  damned by that world. We choose to wear the sign of the dollar on our foreheads, proudly, as our badge of nobility—the badge we are willing to live for and, if need be, to die.”</div>
<div class="tx">He extended his hand for the package. She held it as if her fingers would not let it go, but gave up and placed it on his palm. With deliberate slowness, as if to underscore the meaning of his gesture, he offered her a cigarette. She took it and placed it between her lips. He took one for himself, struck a match, lighted both, and they walked on.</div>
<div class="tx">They walked, over rotting logs that sank without resistance into the shifting ground, through a vast, uncongealed globe of moonlight and coiling mist—with two spots of living fire in their hands and the glow of two small circles to light their faces.</div>
<div class="tx">“Fire, a dangerous force, tamed at his fingertips ...” she remembered the old man saying to her, the old man who had said that these cigarettes were not made anywhere on earth. “When a man thinks, there is a spot of fire alive in his mind—and it’s proper that he should have the burning point of a cigarette as his one expression.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I wish you’d tell me who makes them,” she said, in the tone of a hopeless plea.</div>
<div class="tx">He chuckled good-naturedly. “I can tell you this much: they’re made by a friend of mine, for sale, but—not being a common carrier —he sells them only to his friends.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Sell me that package, will you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t think you’ll be able to afford it, Miss Taggart, but—all right, if you wish.”</div>
<div class="tx">“How much is it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Five cents.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Five cents?” she repeated, bewildered.</div>
<div class="tx">“Five cents—” he said, and added, “in gold.”</div>
<div class="tx">She stopped, staring at him. “In gold?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, Miss Taggart.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, what’s your rate of exchange? How much is it in our normal money?”</div>
<div class="tx">“There is no rate of exchange, Miss Taggart. No amount of physical—or spiritual—currency, whose sole standard of value is the decree of Mr. Wesley Mouch, will buy these cigarettes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I see.”</div>
<div class="tx">He reached into his pocket, took out the package and handed it to her. “I’ll give them to you, Miss Taggart,” he said, “because you’ve earned them many times over—and because you need them for the same purpose we do.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What purpose?”</div>
<div class="tx">“To remind us—in moments of discouragement, in the loneliness of exile—of our true homeland, which has always been yours, too, Miss Taggart.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Thank you,” she said. She put the cigarettes in her pocket; he saw that her hand was trembling.</div>
<div class="tx">When they reached the fourth of the five mileposts, they had been silent for a long time, with no strength left for anything but the effort of moving their feet. Far ahead, they saw a dot of light, too low on the horizon and too harshly clear to be a star. They kept watching it, as they walked, and said nothing until they became certain that it was a powerful electric beacon blazing in the midst of the empty prairie.</div>
<div class="tx">“What is that?” she asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know,” he said. “It looks like—”</div>
<div class="tx">“No,” she broke in hastily, “it couldn’t be. Not around here.”</div>
<div class="tx">She did not want to hear him name the hope which she had felt for many minutes past. She could not permit herself to think of it or to know that the thought was hope.</div>
<div class="tx">They found the telephone box at the fifth milepost. The beacon hung like a violent spot of cold fire, less than half a mile farther south.</div>
<div class="tx">The telephone was working. She heard the buzz of the wire, like the breath of a living creature, when she lifted the receiver. Then a drawling voice answered, “Jessup, at Bradshaw.” The voice sounded sleepy.</div>
<div class="tx">“This is Dagny Taggart, speaking from—”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Dagny Taggart, of Taggart Transcontinental, speaking—”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh ... Oh yes ... I see ... Yes?”</div>
<div class="tx">“—speaking from your track phone Number 83. The Comet is stalled seven miles north of here. It’s been abandoned. The crew has deserted.”</div>
<div class="tx">There was a pause. “Well, what do you want me to do about it?”</div>
<div class="tx">She had to pause in turn, in order to believe it. “Are you the night dispatcher?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yeah.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then send another crew out to us at once.”</div>
<div class="tx">“A full passenger train crew?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Of course.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Now?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">There was a pause. “The rules don’t say anything about that.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Get me the chief dispatcher,” she said, choking.</div>
<div class="tx">“He’s away on his vacation.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Get the division superintendent.”</div>
<div class="tx">“He’s gone down to Laurel for a couple of days.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Get me somebody who’s in charge.”</div>
<div class="tx">.“I’m in charge.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Listen,” she said slowly, fighting for patience, “do you understand that there’s a train, a passenger limited, abandoned in the middle of the prairie?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yeah, but how am I to know what I’m supposed to do about it? The rules don’t provide for it. Now if you had an accident, we’d send out the wrecker, but if there was no accident ... you don’t need the wrecker, do you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. We don’t need the wrecker. We need men. Do you understand ? Living men to run an engine.”</div>
<div class="tx">“The rules don’t say anything about a train without men. Or about men without a train. There’s no rule for calling out a full crew in the middle of the night and sending them to hunt for a train somewhere. I’ve never heard of it before.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re hearing it now. Don’t you know what you have to do?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who am I to know?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you know that your job is to keep trains moving?”</div>
<div class="tx">“My job is to obey the rules. If I send out a crew when I’m not supposed to, God only knows what’s going to happen! What with the Unification Board and all the regulations they’ve got nowadays, who am I to take it upon myself?”</div>
<div class="tx">“And what’s going to happen if you leave a train stalled on the line?”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s not my fault. I had nothing to do with it. They can’t blame me. I couldn’t help it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re to help it now.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Nobody told me to.”</div>
<div class="tx"><i>“I’m</i> telling you to!”</div>
<div class="tx">“How do I know whether you’re supposed to tell me or not? We’re not supposed to furnish any Taggart crews. You people were to run with your own crews. That’s what we were told.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But this is an emergency!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Nobody told me anything about an emergency.”</div>
<div class="tx">She had to take a few seconds to control herself. She saw Kellogg watching her with a bitter smile of amusement.</div>
<div class="tx">“Listen,” she said into the phone, “do you know that the Comet was due at Bradshaw over three hours ago?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, sure. But nobody’s going to make any trouble about that. No train’s ever on schedule these days.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then do you intend to leave us blocking your track forever?”</div>
<div class="tx">“We’ve got nothing due till Number 4, the northbound passenger out of Laurel, at eight thirty-seven A.M. You can wait till then. The day-trick dispatcher will be on then. You can speak to him.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You blasted idiot! This is <i>the Comet!”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“What’s that to me? This isn’t Taggart Transcontinental. You people expect a lot for your money. You’ve been nothing but a headache to us, with all the extra work at no extra pay for the little fellows.” His voice was slipping into whining insolence. “You can’t talk to me  that way. The time’s past when you could talk to people that way.”</div>
<div class="tx">She had never believed that there were men with whom a certain method, which she had never used, would work; such men were not hired by Taggart Transcontinental and she had never been forced to deal with them before.</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you know who I am?” she asked, in the cold, overbearing tone of a personal threat.</div>
<div class="tx">It worked. “I ... I guess so,” he answered.</div>
<div class="tx">“Then let me tell you that if you don’t send a crew to me at once, you’ll be out of a job within one hour after I reach Bradshaw, which I’ll reach sooner or later. You’d better make it sooner.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, ma.‘am,” he said.</div>
<div class="tx">“Call out a full passenger train crew and give them orders to run us to Laurel, where we have our own men.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, ma.‘am.” He added, “Will you tell headquarters that it was you who told me to do it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I will.”</div>
<div class="tx">“And that it’s you who’re responsible for it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I am.”</div>
<div class="tx">There was a pause, then he asked helplessly, “Now how am I going to call the men? Most of them haven’t got any phones.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you have a call boy?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, but he won’t get here till morning.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Is there anybody in the yards right now?”</div>
<div class="tx">“There’s the wiper in the roundhouse.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Send <i>him</i> out to call the men.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, ma.‘am. Hold the line.”</div>
<div class="tx">She leaned against the side of the phone box, to wait. Kellogg was smiling.</div>
<div class="tx">“And you propose to run a railroad—a transcontinental railroad—with <i>that?”</i> he asked.</div>
<div class="tx">She shrugged.</div>
<div class="tx">She could not keep her eyes off the beacon. It seemed so close, so easily within her reach. She felt as if the unconfessed thought were struggling furiously against her, splattering bits of the struggle all over her mind: A man able to harness an untapped source of energy, a man working on a motor to make all other motors useless ... she could be talking to him, to his kind of brain, in a few hours ... in just a few hours.... What if there was no need to hurry to him? It was what she wanted to do. It was all she wanted.... Her work? What was her work: to move on to the fullest, most exacting use of her mind—or to spend the rest of her life doing his thinking for a man unfit to be a night dispatcher? Why had she chosen to work? Was it in order to remain where she had started—night operator of Rockdale Station—no, lower than that—she had been better than that dispatcher, even at Rockdale—was this to be the final sum: an end  lower than her beginning? ... There was no reason to hurry? <i>She</i>  was the reason.... They needed the trains, but they did not need the motor? <i>She</i> needed the motor.... Her duty? To whom?</div>
<div class="tx">The dispatcher was gone for a long time; when he came back, his voice sounded sulky: “Well, the wiper says he can get the men all right, but it’s no use, because how am I going to send them out to you? We have no engine.”</div>
<div class="tx">“No engine?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. The superintendent took one to run down to Laurel, and the other’s in the shops, been there for weeks, and the switch engine jumped a rail this morning, they’ll be working on her till tomorrow afternoon.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What about the wrecker’s engine that you were offering to send us?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, she’s up north. They had a wreck there yesterday. She hasn’t come back yet.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Have you a Diesel car?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Never had any such thing. Not around here.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Have you a track motor car?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes. We have that.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Send them out on the track motor car.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh ... Yes, ma.‘am.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Tell your men to stop here, at track phone Number 83, to pick up Mr. Kellogg and myself.” She was looking at the beacon.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, ma.‘am.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Call the Taggart trainmaster at Laurel, report the Comet’s delay and explain to him what happened.” She put her hand into her pocket and suddenly clutched her fingers: she felt the package of cigarettes. “Say—” she asked, “what’s that beacon, about half a mile from here?”</div>
<div class="tx">“From where you are? Oh, that must be the emergency landing field of the Flagship Airlines.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I see ... Well, that’s all. Get your men started at once. Tell them to pick up Mr. Kellogg by track phone Number 83.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, ma.‘am.”</div>
<div class="tx">She hung up. Kellogg was grinning.</div>
<div class="tx">“An airfield, isn’t it?” he asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes.” She stood looking at the beacon, her hand still clutching the cigarettes in her pocket.</div>
<div class="tx">“So they’re going to pick up Mr. <i>Kellogg,</i> are they?”</div>
<div class="tx">She whirled to him, realizing what decision her mind had been reaching without her conscious knowledge. “No,” she said, “no, I didn’t mean to abandon you here. It’s only that I, too, have a crucial purpose out West, where I ought to hurry, so I was thinking of trying to catch a plane, but I can’t do it and it’s not necessary.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Come on,” he said, starting in the direction of the airfield.</div>
<div class="tx">“But I—”</div>
<div class="tx">“If there’s anything you want to do more urgently than to nurse those morons—go right ahead.”</div>
<div class="tx">“More urgently than anything in the world,” she whispered.</div>
<div class="tx">“I’ll undertake to remain in charge for you and to deliver the Comet to your man at Laurel.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Thank you ... But if you’re hoping ... I’m not deserting, you know.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I know.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then why are you so eager to help me?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I just want you to see what it’s like to do something you want, for once.”</div>
<div class="tx">“There’s not much chance that they’ll have a plane at that field.”</div>
<div class="tx">“There’s a good chance that they will.”</div>
<div class="tx">There were two planes on the edge of the airfield: one, the half-charred remnant of a wreck, not worth salvaging for scrap—the other, a Dwight Sanders monoplane, brand-new, the kind of ship that men were pleading for, in vain, all over the country.</div>
<div class="tx">There was one sleepy attendant at the airfield, young, pudgy and, but for a faint smell of college about his vocabulary, a brain-brother of the night dispatcher of Bradshaw. He knew nothing about the two planes: they had been there when he first took this job a year ago. He had never inquired about them and neither had anybody else. In whatever silent crumbling had gone on at the distant headquarters, in the slow dissolution of a great airline company, the Sanders monoplane had been forgotten—as assets of this nature were being forgotten everywhere ... as the model of the motor had been forgotten on a junk pile and, left in plain sight, had conveyed nothing to the inheritors and the takers-over....</div>
<div class="tx">There were no rules to tell the young attendant whether he was expected to keep the Sanders plane or not. The decision was made for him by the brusque, confident manner of the two strangers—by the credentials of Miss Dagny Taggart, Vice-President of a railroad-by brief hints about a secret, emergency mission, which sounded like Washington to him—by the mention of an agreement with the airline’s top officials in New York, whose names he had never heard before—by a check for fifteen thousand dollars, written by Miss Taggart, as deposit against the return of the Sanders plane—and by another check, for two hundred bucks, for his own, personal courtesy.</div>
<div class="tx">He fueled the plane, he checked it as best he could, he found a map of the country’s airports—and she saw that a landing field on the outskirts of Afton, Utah, was marked as still in existence. She had been too tensely, swiftly active to feel anything, but at the last moment, when the attendant switched on the floodlights, when she was about to climb aboard, she paused to glance at the emptiness of the sky, then at Owen Kellogg. He stood, alone in the white glare, his  feet planted firmly apart, on an island of cement in a ring of blinding lights, with nothing beyond the ring but an irredeemable night—and she wondered which one of them was taking the greater chance and facing the more desolate emptiness.</div>
<div class="tx">“In case anything happens to me,” she said, “will you tell Eddie Willers in my office to give Jeff Allen a job, as I promised?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I will.... Is this all you wish to be done .. , in case anything happens?”</div>
<div class="tx">She considered it and smiled sadly, in astonishment at the realization. “Yes, I guess that’s all ... Except, tell Hank Rearden what happened and that I asked you to tell him.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I will.”</div>
<div class="tx">She lifted her head and said firmly, “I don’t expect it to happen, however. When you reach Laurel, call Winston, Colorado, and tell them that I will be there tomorrow by noon.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, Miss Taggart.”</div>
<div class="tx">She wanted to extend her hand in parting, but it seemed inadequate, and then she remembered what he had said about times of loneliness. She took out the package and silently offered him one of his own cigarettes. His smile was a full statement of understanding, and the small flame of his match lighting their two cigarettes was their most enduring handshake.</div>
<div class="tx">Then she climbed aboard—and the next span of her consciousness was not separate moments and movements, but the sweep of a single motion and a single unit of time, a progression forming one entity, like the notes of a piece of music: from the touch of her hand on the starter—to the blast of the motor’s sound that broke off, like a mountain rockslide, all contact with the time behind her—to the circling fall of a blade that vanished in a fragile sparkle of whirling air that cut the space ahead—to the start for the runway—to the brief pause—then to the forward thrust—to the long, perilous run, the run not to be obstructed, the straight line run that gathers power by spending it on a harder and harder and ever-accelerating effort, the straight line to a purpose—to the moment, unnoticed, when the earth drops off and the line, unbroken, goes on into space in the simple, natural act of rising.</div>
<div class="tx">She saw the telegraph wires of the trackside slipping past at the tip of her toes. The earth was falling downward, and she felt as if its weight were dropping off her ankles, as if the globe would go shrinking to the size of a ball, a convict’s ball she had dragged and lost. Her body swayed, drunk with the shock of a discovery, and her craft rocked with her body, and it was the earth below that reeled with the rocking of her craft—the discovery that her life was now in her own hands, that there was no necessity to argue, to explain, to teach, to plead, to fight—nothing but to see and think and act. Then the earth steadied into a wide black sheet that grew wider and wider as she  circled, rising. When she glanced down for the last time, the lights of the field were extinguished, there was only the single beacon left and it looked like the tip of Kellogg’s cigarette, glowing as a last salute in the darkness.</div>
<div class="tx">Then she was left with the lights on her instrument panel and the spread of stars beyond her film of glass. There was nothing to support her but the beat of the engine and the minds of the men who had made the plane. But what else supports one anywhere?—she thought.</div>
<div class="tx">The line of her course went northwest, to cut a diagonal across the state of Colorado. She knew she had chosen the most dangerous route, over too long a stretch of the worst mountain barrier—but it was the shortest line, and safety lay in altitude, and no mountains seemed dangerous compared to the dispatcher of Bradshaw.</div>
<div class="tx">The stars were like foam and the sky seemed full of flowing motion, the motion of bubbles settling and forming, the floating of circular waves without progression. A spark of light flared up on earth once in a while, and it seemed brighter than all the static blue above. But it hung alone, between the black of ashes and the blue of a crypt, it seemed to fight for its fragile foothold, it greeted her and .went.</div>
<div class="tx">The pale streak of a river came rising slowly from the void, and for a long stretch of time it remained in sight, gliding imperceptibly to meet her. It looked like a phosphorescent vein showing through the skin of the earth, a delicate vein without blood.</div>
<div class="tx">When she saw the lights of a town, like a handful of gold coins flung upon the prairie, the brightly violent lights fed by an electric current, they seemed as distant as the stars and now as unattainable. The energy that had lighted them was gone, the power that created power stations in empty prairies had vanished, and she knew of no journey to recapture it. Yet these had been her stars—she thought, looking down—these had been her goal, her beacon, the aspiration drawing her upon her upward course. That which others claimed to feel at the sight of the stars—stars safely distant by millions of years and thus imposing no obligation to act, but serving as the tinsel of futility—she had felt at the sight of electric bulbs lighting the streets of a town. It was this earth below that had been the height she had wanted to reach, and she wondered how she had come to lose it, who had made of it a convict’s ball to drag through muck, who had turned its promise of greatness into a vision never to be reached. But the town was past, and she had to look ahead, to the mountains of Colorado rising in her way.</div>
<div class="tx">The small glass dial on her panel showed that she was now climbing. The sound of the engine, beating through the metal shell around her, trembling in the wheel against her palms, like the pounding of a heart strained to a solemn effort, told her of the power carrying her above the peaks. The earth was now a crumpled sculpture that swayed from side to  side, the shape of an explosion still shooting sudden spurts to reach the plane. She saw them as dented black cuts ripping through the milky spread of stars, straight in her path and tearing wider. Her mind one with her body and her body one with the plane, she fought the invisible suction drawing her downward, she fought the sudden gusts that tipped the earth as if she were about to roll off into the sky, with half of the mountains rolling after. It was like fighting a frozen ocean where the touch of a single spray would be fatal.</div>
<div class="tx">There were stretches of rest when the mountains shrank down, over valleys filled with fog. Then the fog rose higher to swallow the earth and she was left suspended in space, left motionless but for the sound of the engine.</div>
<div class="tx">But she did not need to see the earth. The instrument panel was now her power of sight—it was the condensed sight of the best minds able to guide her on her way. Their condensed sight, she thought, offered to hers and requiring only that she be able to read it. How had they been paid for it, they, the sight-givers? From condensed milk to condensed music to the condensed sight of precision instruments—what wealth had they not given to the world and what had they received in return? Where were they now? Where was Dwight Sanders? Where was the inventor of her motor?</div>
<div class="tx">The fog was lifting—and in a sudden clearing, she saw a drop of fire on a spread of rock. It was not an electric light, it was a lonely flame in the darkness of the earth. She knew where she was and she knew that flame: it was Wyatt’s Torch.</div>
<div class="tx">She was coming close to her goal. Somewhere behind her, in the northeast, stood the summits pierced by the Taggart Tunnel. The mountains were sliding in a long descent into the steadier soil of Utah. She let her plane slip closer to the earth.</div>
<div class="tx">The stars were vanishing, the sky was growing darker, but in the bank of clouds to the east thin cracks were beginning to appear—first as threads, then faint spots of reflection, then straight bands that were not yet pink, but no longer blue, the color of a future light, the first hints of the coming sunrise. They kept appearing and vanishing, slowly growing clearer, leaving the sky darker, then breaking it wider apart, like a promise struggling to be fulfilled. She heard a piece of music beating in her mind, one she seldom liked to recall: not Halley’s Fifth Concerto, but his Fourth, the cry of a tortured struggle, with the chords of its theme breaking through, like a distant vision to be reached.</div>
<div class="tx">She saw the Afton airport from across a span of miles, first as a square of sparks, then as a sunburst of white rays. It was lighted for a plane about to take off, and she had to wait for her landing. Circling in the outer darkness above the field, she saw the silver body of a plane rising like a phoenix out of the white fire and—in a straight line, almost leaving an instant’s trail of light to hang in space behind it—going off toward the east.</div>
<div class="tx">Then she swept down in its stead, to dive into the luminous funnel of beams—she saw a strip of cement flying at her face, she felt the jolt of the wheels stopping it in time, then the streak of her motion ebbing out and the plane being tamed to the safety of a car, as it taxied smoothly off the runway.</div>
<div class="tx">It was a small private airfield, serving the meager traffic of a few industrial concerns still remaining in Afton. She saw a lone attendant hurrying to meet her. She leaped down to the ground the moment the plane stood still, the hours of the flight swept from her mind by the impatience over the stretch of a few more minutes.</div>
<div class="tx">“Can I get a car somewhere to drive me to the Institute of Technology at once?” she asked.</div>
<div class="tx">The attendant looked at her, puzzled. “Why, yes, I guess so, ma.‘am. But... but what for? There’s nobody there.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Mr. Quentin Daniels is there.”</div>
<div class="tx">The attendant shook his head slowly—then jerked his thumb, pointing east to the shrinking taillights of the plane. “There’s Mr. Daniels going now.”</div>
<div class="tx"><i>“What?”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“He just left.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Left? Why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“He went with the man who flew in for him two-three hours ago.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What man?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Don’t know, never saw him before, but, boy!—he’s got a beauty of a ship!”</div>
<div class="tx">She was back at the wheel, she was speeding down the runway, she was rising into the air, her plane like a bullet aimed at two sparks of red and green light that were twinkling away into the eastern sky—while she was still repeating, “Oh no, they don‘t! They don’.t! They don‘t! They don’.t!”</div>
<div class="tx">Once and for all—she thought, clutching the wheel as if it were the enemy not to be relinquished, her words like separate explosions with a trail of fire in her mind to link them—once and for all ... to meet the destroyer face to face... to learn who he is and where he goes to vanish... not the motor... he is not to carry the motor away into the darkness of his monstrously closed unknown . . . he is not to escape, this time....</div>
<div class="tx">A band of light was rising in the east and it seemed to come from the earth, as a breath long-held and released. In the deep blue above it, the stranger’s plane was a single spark changing color and flashing from side to side, like the tip of a pendulum swinging in the darkness, beating time.</div>
<div class="tx">The curve of distance made the spark drop closer to the earth, and she pushed her throttle wide open, not to let the spark out of her sight, not to let it touch the horizon and vanish. The light was flowing into the sky, as if drawn from the earth by the stranger’s plane. The plane was  headed southeast, and she was following it into the coming sunrise.</div>
<div class="tx">From the transparent green of ice, the sky melted into pale gold, and the gold spread into a lake under a fragile film of pink glass, the color of that forgotten morning which was the first she had seen on earth. The clouds were dropping away in long shreds of smoky blue. She kept her eyes on the stranger’s plane, as if her glance were a towline pulling her ship. The stranger’s plane was now a small black cross, like a shrinking check mark on the glowing sky.</div>
<div class="tx">Then she noticed that the clouds were not dropping, that they stood congealed on the edge of the earth—and she realized that the plane was headed toward the mountains of Colorado, that the struggle against the invisible storm lay ahead for her once more. She noted it without emotion; she did not wonder whether her ship or her body had the power to attempt it again. So long as she was able to move, she would move to follow the speck that was fleeing away with the last of her world. She felt nothing but the emptiness left by a fire that had been hatred and anger and the desperate impulse of a fight to the kill; these had fused into a single icy streak, the single resolve to follow the stranger, whoever he was, wherever he took her, to follow and... she added nothing in her mind, but, unstated, what lay at the bottom of the emptiness was: and give her life, if she could take his first.</div>
<div class="tx">Like an instrument set to automatic control, her body was performing the motions of driving the plane—with the mountains reeling in a bluish fog below and the dented peaks rising in her path as smoky formations of a deadlier blue. She noticed that the distance to the stranger’s plane had shrunk: he had checked his speed for the dangerous crossing, while she had gone on, unconscious of the danger, with only the muscles of her arms and legs fighting to keep her plane aloft. A brief, tight movement of her lips was as close as she could come to a smile: it was he who was flying her plane for her, she thought; he had given her the power to follow him with a somnambulist’s unerring skill.</div>
<div class="tx">As if responding of itself to his control, the needle of her altimeter was slowly moving upward. She was rising and she went on rising and she wondered when her breath and her propeller would fail. He was going southeast, toward the highest mountains that obstructed the path of the sun.</div>
<div class="tx">It was his plane that was struck by the first sunray. It flashed for an instant, like a burst of white fire, sending rays to shoot from its wings. The peaks of the mountains came next: she saw the sunlight reaching the snow in the crevices, then trickling down the granite sides; it cut violent shadows on the ledges and brought the mountains into the living finality of a form.</div>
<div class="tx">They were flying over the wildest stretch of Colorado, uninhabited, uninhabitable, inaccessible to men on foot or plane. No landing was possible within a radius of a hundred miles; she glanced at her fuel  gauge: she had one half-hour left. The stranger was heading straight toward another, higher range. She wondered why he chose a course no air route did or ever would travel. She wished this range were behind her; it was the last effort she could hope to make.</div>
<div class="tx">The stranger’s plane was suddenly slacking its speed. He was losing altitude just when she had expected him to climb. The granite barrier was rising in his path, moving to meet him, reaching for his wings—but the long, smooth line of his motion was sliding down. She could detect no break, no jolt, no sign of mechanical failure; it looked like the even movement of a controlled intention. With a sudden flash of sunlight on its wings, the plane banked into a long curve, rays dripping like water from its body—then went into the broad, smooth circles of a spiral, as if circling for a landing where no landing was conceivable.</div>
<div class="tx">She watched, not trying to explain it, not believing what she saw, waiting for the upward thrust that would throw him back on his course. But the easy, gliding circles went on dropping, toward a ground she could not see and dared not think of. Like remnants of broken jaws, strings of granite dentures stood between her ship and his; she could not tell what lay at the bottom of his spiral motion. She knew only that it did not look like, but was certain to be, the motion of a suicide.</div>
<div class="tx">She saw the sunlight glitter on his wings for an instant. Then, like the body of a man diving chest-first and arms outstretched, serenely abandoned to the sweep of the fall, the plane went down and vanished behind the ridges of rock.</div>
<div class="tx">She flew on, almost waiting for it to reappear, unable to believe that she had witnessed a horrible catastrophe taking place so simply and quietly. She flew on to where the plane had dropped. It seemed to be a valley in a ring of granite walls.</div>
<div class="tx">She reached the valley and looked down. There was no possible place for a landing. There was no sign of a plane.</div>
<div class="tx">The bottom of the valley looked like a stretch of the earth’s crust mangled in the days when the earth was cooling, left irretrievable ever since. It was a stretch of rocks ground against one another, with boulders hanging in precarious formations, with long, dark crevices and a few contorted pine trees growing half-horizontally into the air. There was no level piece of soil the size of a handkerchief. There was no place for a plane to hide. There was no remnant of a plane’s wreck.</div>
<div class="tx">She banked sharply, circling above the valley, dropping down a little. By some trick of light, which she could not explain, the floor of the valley seemed more clearly visible than the rest of the earth. She could distinguish it well enough to know that the plane was not there; yet this was not possible.</div>
<div class="tx">She circled, dropping down farther. She glanced around her—and  for one frightening moment, she thought that it was a quiet summer morning, that she was alone, lost in a region of the Rocky Mountains which no plane should ever venture to approach, and, with the last of her fuel burning away, she was looking for a plane that had never existed, in quest of a destroyer who had vanished as he always vanished; perhaps it was only his vision that had led her here to be destroyed. In the next moment, she shook her head, pressed her mouth tighter and dropped farther.</div>
<div class="tx">She thought that she could not abandon an incalculable wealth such as the brain of Quentin Daniels on one of those rocks below, if he was still alive and within her reach to help. She had dropped inside the circle of the valley’s walls. It was a dangerous job of flying, the space was much too tight, but she went on circling and dropping lower, her life hanging on her eyesight, and her eyesight flashing between two tasks: searching the floor of the valley and watching the granite walls that seemed about to rip her wings.</div>
<div class="tx">She knew the danger only as part of the job. It had no personal meaning any longer. The savage thing she felt was almost enjoyment. It was the last rage of a lost battle. No!—she was crying in her mind, crying it to the destroyer, to the world she had left, to the years behind her, to the long progression of defeat—No! ... No! .... No! ...</div>
<div class="tx">Her eyes swept past the instrument panel—and then she sat still but for the sound of a gasp. Her altimeter had stood at 11,000 feet the last time she remembered seeing it. Now it stood at 10,000. But the floor of the valley had not changed. It had come no closer. It remained as distant as at her first glance down.</div>
<div class="tx">She knew that the figure 8,000 meant the level of the ground in this part of Colorado. She had not noticed the length of her descent. She had not noticed that the ground, which had seemed too clear and too close from the height, was now too dim and too far. She was looking at the same rocks from the same perspective, they had grown no larger, their shadows had not moved, and the oddly unnatural light still hung over the bottom of the valley.</div>
<div class="tx">She thought that her altimeter was off, and she went on circling downward. She saw the needle of her dial moving down, she saw the walls of granite moving up, she saw the ring of mountains growing higher, its peaks coming closer together in the sky—but the floor of the valley remained unchanged, as if she were dropping down a well with a bottom never to be reached. The needle moved to 9,500—to 9,300—to 9,000—to 8,700.</div>
<div class="tx">The flash of light that hit her had no source. It was as if the air within and beyond the plane became an explosion of blinding cold fire, sudden and soundless. The shock threw her back, her hands off the wheel and over her eyes. In the break of an instant, when she seized the wheel again, the light was gone, but her ship was spinning,  her ears were bursting with silence and her propeller stood stiffly straight before her: her motor was dead.</div>
<div class="tx">She tried to pull for a rise, but the ship was going down—and what she saw flying at her face was not the spread of mangled boulders, but the green grass of a field where no field had been before.</div>
<div class="tx">There was no time to see the rest. There was no time to think of explanations. There was no time to come out of the spin. The earth was a green ceiling coming down upon her, a few hundred swiftly shrinking feet away.</div>
<div class="tx">Flung from side to side, like a battered pendulum, clinging to the wheel, half in her seat, half on her knees, she fought to pull the ship into a glide, for an attempt to make a belly-landing, while the green ground was whirling about her, sweeping above her, then below, its spiral coils coming closer. Her arms pulling at the wheel, with no chance to know whether she could succeed, with her space and time running out—she felt, in a flash of its full, violent purity, that special sense of existence which had always been hers. In a moment’s consecration to her love—to her rebellious denial of disaster, to her love of life and of the matchless value that was herself—she felt the fiercely proud certainty that she would survive.</div>
<div class="tx">And in answer to the earth that flew to meet her, she heard in her mind, as her mockery at fate, as her cry of defiance, the words of the sentence she hated—the words of defeat, of despair and of a plea for help:</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh hell! Who is John Galt?”</div>
