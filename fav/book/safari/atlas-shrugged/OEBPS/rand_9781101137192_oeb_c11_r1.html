<div class="ct">CHAPTER I</div>
<div class="cst">THE MAN WHO BELONGED ON EARTH</div>
<div class="tx1">Dr. Robert Stadler paced his office, wishing he would not feel the cold.</div>
<div class="tx">Spring had been late in coming. Beyond the window, the dead gray of the hills looked like the smeared transition from the soiled white of the sky to the leaden black of the river. Once in a while, a distant patch of hillside flared into a silver-yellow that was almost green, then vanished. The clouds kept cracking for the width of a single sunray, then oozing closed again. It was not cold in the office, thought Dr. Stadler, it was that view that froze the place.</div>
<div class="tx">It was not cold today, the chill was in his bones—he thought—the stored accumulation of the winter months, when he had had to be distracted from his work by an awareness of such a matter as inadequate heating and people had talked about conserving fuel. It was preposterous, he thought, this growing intrusion of the accidents of nature into the affairs of men: it had never mattered before, if a winter happened to be unusually severe; if a flood washed out a section of railroad track, one did not spend two weeks eating canned vegetables; if an electric storm struck some power station, an establishment such as the State Science Institute was not left without electricity for five days. Five days of stillness this winter, he thought, with the great laboratory motors stopped and irretrievable hours wiped out, when his staff had been working on problems that involved the heart of the universe. He turned angrily away from the window—but stopped and turned back to it again. He did not want to see the book that lay on his desk.</div>
<div class="tx">He wished Dr. Ferris would come. He glanced at his watch: Dr. Ferris was late—an astonishing matter—late for an appointment with  <i>him</i>—Dr. Floyd Ferris, the valet of science, who had always faced him in a manner that suggested an apology for having but one hat to take off.</div>
<div class="tx">This was outrageous weather for the month of May, he thought, looking down at the river; it was certainly the weather that made him feel as he did, not the book. He had placed the book in plain view on his desk, when he had noted that his reluctance to see it was more than mere revulsion, that it contained the element of an emotion  never to be admitted. He told himself that he had risen from his desk, not because the book lay there, but merely because he had wanted to move, feeling cold. He paced the room, trapped between the desk and the window. He would throw that book in the ash can where it belonged, he thought, just as soon as he had spoken to Dr. Ferris.</div>
<div class="tx">He watched the patch of green and sunlight on the distant hill, the promise of spring in a world that looked as if no grass or bud would ever function again. He smiled eagerly—and when the patch vanished, he felt a stab of humiliation, at his own eagerness, at the desperate way he had wanted to hold it. It reminded him of that interview with the eminent novelist, last winter. The novelist had come from Europe to write an article about him—and he, who had once despised interviews, had talked eagerly, lengthily, too lengthily, seeing a promise of intelligence in the novelist’s face, feeling a causeless, desperate need to be understood. The article had come out as a collection of sentences that gave him exorbitant praise and garbled every thought he had expressed. Closing the magazine, he had felt what he was feeling now at the desertion of a sunray.</div>
<div class="tx">All right—he thought, turning away from the window—he would concede that attacks of loneliness had begun to strike him at times; but it was a loneliness to which he was entitled, it was hunger for the response of some living, thinking mind. He was so tired of all those people, he thought in contemptuous bitterness; he dealt with cosmic rays, while they were unable to deal with an electric storm.</div>
<div class="tx">He felt the sudden contraction of his mouth, like a slap denying him the right to pursue this course of thought. He was looking at the book on his desk. Its glossy jacket was glaring and new; it had been published two weeks ago. But I had nothing to do with it!—he screamed to himself; the scream seemed wasted on a merciless silence; nothing answered it, no echo of forgiveness. The title on the book’s jacket was  <i>Why Do You Think You Think?</i></div>
<div class="tx">There was no sound in that courtroom silence within him, no pity, no voice of defense—nothing but the paragraphs which his great memory had reprinted on his brain:</div>
<div class="tx">“Thought is a primitive superstition. Reason is an irrational idea. The childish notion that we are able to think has been mankind’s costliest error.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What you think you think is an illusion created by your glands, your emotions and, in the last analysis, by the content of your stomach.”</div>
<div class="tx">“That gray matter you’re so proud of is like a mirror in an amusement park which transmits to you nothing but distorted signals from a reality forever beyond your grasp.”</div>
<div class="tx">“The more certain you feel of your rational conclusions, the more certain you are to be wrong. Your brain being an instrument of distortion, the more active the brain the greater the distortion.”</div>
<div class="tx">“The giants of the intellect, whom you admire so much, once taught you that the earth was flat and that the atom was the smallest particle of matter. The entire history of science is a progression of exploded fallacies, not of achievements.”</div>
<div class="tx">“The more we know, the more we learn that we know nothing.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Only the crassest ignoramus can still hold to the old-fashioned notion that seeing is believing. That which you see is the first thing to disbelieve.”</div>
<div class="tx">“A scientist knows that a stone is not a stone at all. It is, in fact, identical with a feather pillow. Both are only a cloud formation of the same invisible, whirling particles. But, you say, you can’t use a stone for a pillow? Well, that merely proves your helplessness in the face of actual reality.”</div>
<div class="tx">“The latest scientific discoveries—such as the tremendous achievements of Dr. Robert Stadler—have demonstrated conclusively that our reason is incapable of dealing with the nature of the universe. These discoveries have led scientists to contradictions which are impossible, according to the human mind, but which exist in reality nonetheless. If you have not yet heard it, my dear old-fashioned friends, it has now been proved that the rational is the insane.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do not expect consistency. Everything is a contradiction of everything else. Nothing exists but contradictions.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do not look for ‘common sense.’ To demand ‘sense’ is the hallmark of nonsense. Nature does not make sense. Nothing makes sense. The only crusaders for ’sense’ are the studious type of adolescent old maid who can’t find a boy friend, and the old-fashioned shopkeeper who thinks that the universe is as simple as his neat little inventory and beloved cash register.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Let us break the chains of the prejudice called Logic. Are we going to be stopped by a syllogism?”</div>
<div class="tx">“So you think you’re sure of your opinions? You cannot be sure of anything. Are you going to endanger the harmony of your community, your fellowship with your neighbors, your standing, reputation, good name and financial security—for the sake of an illusion? For the sake of the mirage of thinking that you think? Are you going to run risks and court disasters—at a precarious time like ours—by opposing the existing social order in the name of those imaginary notions of yours which you call your convictions? You say that you’re sure you’re right? Nobody is right, or ever can be. You feel that the world around you is wrong? You have no means to know it. Everything is wrong in human eyes—so why fight it? Don’t argue. Accept. Adjust yourself. Obey.”</div>
<div class="tx">The book was written by Dr. Floyd Ferris and published by the State Science Institute.</div>
<div class="tx">“I had nothing to do with it!” said Dr. Robert Stadler. He stood still by the side of his desk, with the uncomfortable feeling of having missed  some beat of time, of not knowing how long the preceding moment had lasted. He had pronounced the words aloud, in a tone of rancorous sarcasm directed at whoever had made him say it.</div>
<div class="tx">He shrugged. Resting on the belief that self-mockery is an act of virtue, the shrug was the emotional equivalent of the sentence: You’re Robert Stadler, don’t act like a high-school neurotic. He sat down at his desk and pushed the book aside with the back of his hand.</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Floyd Ferris arrived half an hour late. “Sorry,” he said, “but my car broke down again on the way from Washington and I had a hell of a time trying to find somebody to fix it—there’s getting to be so damn few cars out on the road that half the service stations are closed.”</div>
<div class="tx">There was more annoyance than apology in his voice. He sat down without waiting for an invitation to do so.</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Floyd Ferris would not have been noticed as particularly handsome in any other profession, but in the one he had chosen he was always described as “that good-looking scientist.” He was six feet tall and forty-five years old, but he managed to look taller and younger. He had an air of immaculate grooming and a ballroom grace of motion, but his clothes were severe, his suits being usually black or midnight blue. He had a finely traced mustache, and his smooth black hair made the Institute office boys say that he used the same shoe polish on both ends of him. He did not mind repeating, in the tone of a joke on himself, that a movie producer once said he would cast him for the part of a titled European gigolo. He had begun his career as a biologist, but that was forgotten long ago; he was famous as the Top Co-ordinator of the State Science Institute.</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Stadler glanced at him with astonishment—the lack of apology was unprecedented—and said dryly, “It seems to me that you are spending a great deal of your time in Washington.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But, Dr. Stadler, wasn’t it you who once paid me the compliment of calling me the watchdog of this Institute?” said Dr. Ferris pleasantly. “Isn’t that my most essential duty?”</div>
<div class="tx">“A few of your duties seem to be accumulating right around this place. Before I forget it, would you mind telling me what’s going on here about that oil shortage mess?”</div>
<div class="tx">He could not understand why Dr. Ferris’ face tightened into an injured look. “You will permit me to say that this is unexpected and unwarranted,” said Dr. Ferris in that tone of formality which conceals pain and reveals martyrdom. “None of the authorities involved have found cause for criticism. We have just submitted a detailed report on the progress of the work to date to the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources, and Mr. Wesley Mouch has expressed himself as satisfied. We have done our best on that project. We have heard no one else describe it as a mess. Considering the difficulties of the terrain, the hazards of the fire and the fact that it has been only six months since we—”</div>
<div class="tx">“What are you talking about?” asked Dr. Stadler.</div>
<div class="tx">“The Wyatt Reclamation Project. Isn’t that what you asked me?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No,” said Dr. Stadler, “no, I ... Wait a moment. Let me get this straight. I seem to recall something about this Institute taking charge of a reclamation project. What is it that you’re reclaiming?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oil,” said Dr. Ferris. “The Wyatt oil fields.”</div>
<div class="tx">“That was a fire, wasn’t it? In Colorado? That was ... wait a moment ... that was the man who set fire to his own oil wells.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m inclined to believe that that’s a rumor created by public hysteria,” said Dr. Ferris dryly. “A rumor with some undesirable, unpatriotic implications. I wouldn’t put too much faith in those newspaper stories. Personally, I believe that it was an accident and that Ellis Wyatt perished in the fire.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, who owns those fields now?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Nobody—at the moment. There being no will or heirs, the government has taken charge of operating the fields—as a measure of public necessity—for seven years. If Ellis Wyatt does not return within that time, he will be considered officially dead.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, why did they come to you—to us, for such an unlikely assignment as oil pumping?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Because it is a problem of great technological difficulty, requiring the services of the best scientific talent available. You see, it is a matter of reconstructing the special method of oil extraction that Wyatt had employed. His equipment is still there, though in a dreadful condition; some of his processes are known, but somehow there is no full record of the complete operation or the basic principle involved. That is what we have to rediscover.”</div>
<div class="tx">“And how is it going?”</div>
<div class="tx">“The progress is most gratifying. We have just been granted a new and larger appropriation. Mr. Wesley Mouch is pleased with our work. So are Mr. Balch of the Emergency Commission, Mr. Anderson of Crucial Supplies and Mr. Pettibone of Consumers’ Protection. I do not see what more could be expected of us. The project is fully successful.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Have you produced any oil?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, but we have succeeded in forcing a flow from one of the wells, to the extent of six and a half gallons. This, of course, is merely of experimental significance, but you must take into consideration the fact that we had to spend three full months just to put out the fire, which has now been totally—almost totally—extinguished. We have a much tougher problem than Wyatt ever had, because he started from scratch while we have to deal with the disfigured wreckage of an act of vicious, anti-social sabotage which ... I mean to say, it is a difficult problem, but there is no doubt that we will be able to solve it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, what I really asked you about was the oil shortage here, in the Institute. The level of temperature maintained in this building all winter was outrageous. They told me that they had to conserve oil.  Surely you could have seen to it that the matter of keeping this place adequately supplied with such things as oil was handled more efficiently.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, is that what you had in mind, Dr. Stadler? Oh, but I am so sorry!” The words came with a bright smile of relief on Dr. Ferris’ face; his solicitous manner returned. “Do you mean that the temperature was low enough to cause you discomfort?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I mean that I nearly froze to death.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But that is unforgivable! Why didn’t they tell me? Please accept my personal apology, Dr. Stadler, and rest assured that you will never be inconvenienced again. The only excuse I can offer for our maintenance department is that the shortage of fuel was not due to their negligence, it was—oh, I realize that you would not know about it and such matters should not take up your invaluable attention—but, you see, the oil shortage last winter was a nation-wide crisis.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why? For heaven’s sake, don’t tell me that those Wyatt fields were the only source of oil in the country!”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, no, but the sudden disappearance of a major supply wrought havoc in the entire oil market. So the government had to assume control and impose oil rationing on the country, in order to protect the essential enterprises. I did obtain an unusually large quota for the Institute—and only by the special favor of some very special connections—but I feel abjectly guilty if this proved insufficient. Rest assured that it will not happen again. It is only a temporary emergency. By next winter, we shall have the Wyatt fields back in production, and conditions will return to normal. Besides, as far as this Institute is concerned, I made all the arrangements to convert our furnaces to coal, and it was to be done next month, only the Stockton Foundry in Colorado closed down suddenly, without notice—they were casting parts for our furnaces, but Andrew Stockton retired, quite unexpectedly, and now we have to wait till his nephew reopens the plant.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I see. Well, I trust that you will take care of it among all your other activities.” Dr. Stadler shrugged with annoyance. “It is becoming a little ridiculous—the number of technological ventures that an institution of science has to handle for the government.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But, Dr. Stadler—”</div>
<div class="tx">“I know, I know, it can’t be avoided. By the way, what is Project X?”</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Ferris’ eyes shot to him swiftly—an odd, bright glance of alertness, that seemed startled, but not frightened. “Where did you hear about Project X, Dr. Stadler?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, I heard a couple of your younger boys saying something about it with an air of mystery you’d expect from amateur detectives. They told me it was something very secret.”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s right, Dr. Stadler. It is an extremely secret research project  which the government has entrusted to us. And it is of utmost importance that the newspapers get no word about it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What’s the X?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Xylophone. Project Xylophone. That is a code name, of course. The work has to do with sound. But I am sure that it would not interest you. It is a purely technological undertaking.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, do spare me the story. I have no time for your technological undertakings.”</div>
<div class="tx">“May I suggest that it would be advisable to refrain from mentioning the words ‘Project X’ to anyone, Dr. Stadler?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, all right, all right. I must say I do not enjoy discussions of that kind.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But of course! And I wouldn’t forgive myself if I allowed your time to be taken up by such concerns. Please feel certain that you may safely leave it to me.” He made a movement to rise. “Now if this was the reason you wanted to see me, please believe that I—”</div>
<div class="tx">“No,” said Dr. Stadler slowly. “This was not the reason I wanted to see you.”</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Ferris volunteered no questions, no eager offers of service; he remained seated, merely waiting.</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Stadler reached over and made the book slide from the corner to the center of his desk, with a contemptuous flick of one hand. “Will you tell me, please,” he asked, “what is this piece of indecency?”</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Ferris did not glance at the book, but kept his eyes fixed on Stadler’s for an inexplicable moment; then he leaned back and said with an odd smile, “I feel honored that you chose to make such an exception for my sake as reading a popular book. This little piece has sold twenty thousand copies in two weeks.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have read it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“And?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I expect an explanation.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you find the text confusing?”</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Stadler looked at him in bewilderment. “Do you realize what theme you chose to treat and in what manner? The style alone, the style, the gutter kind of attitude—for a subject of this nature!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you think, then, that the content deserved a more dignified form of presentation?” The voice was so innocently smooth that Dr. Stadler could not decide whether this was mockery.</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you realize what you’re preaching in this book?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Since you do not seem to approve of it, Dr. Stadler, I’d rather have you think that I wrote it innocently.”</div>
<div class="tx">This was it, thought Dr. Stadler, this was the incomprehensible element in Ferris’ manner: he had supposed that an indication of his disapproval would be sufficient, but Ferris seemed to remain untouched by it.</div>
<div class="tx">“If a drunken lout could find the power to express himself on paper,” said Dr. Stadler, “if he could give voice to his essence—the eternal savage, leering his hatred of the mind—this is the sort of book I would expect him to write. But to see it come from a scientist, under the imprint of this Institute!”</div>
<div class="tx">“But, Dr. Stadler, this book was not intended to be read by scientists. It was written for that drunken lout.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What do you mean?”</div>
<div class="tx">“For the general public.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But, good God! The feeblest imbecile should be able to see the glaring contradictions in every one of your statements.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Let us put it this way, Dr. Stadler: the man who doesn’t see that, deserves to believe all my statements.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But you’ve given the prestige of science to that unspeakable stuff! It was all right for a disreputable mediocrity like Simon Pritchett to drool it as some sort of woozy mysticism—nobody listened to him. But you’ve made them think it’s science. <i>Science!</i> You’ve taken the achievements of the mind to destroy the mind. By what right did you use <i>my</i>  work to make an unwarranted, preposterous switch into another field, pull an inapplicable metaphor and draw a monstrous generalization out of what is merely a mathematical problem? By what right did you make it sound as if I—<i>I!</i>—gave my sanction to that book?”</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Ferris did nothing, he merely looked at Dr. Stadler calmly; but the calm gave him an air that was almost patronizing. “Now, you see, Dr. Stadler, you’re speaking as if this book were addressed to a thinking audience. If it were, one would have to be concerned with such matters as accuracy, validity, logic and the prestige of science. But it isn’t. It’s addressed to the public. And you have always been first to believe that the public does not think.” He paused, but Dr. Stadler said nothing. “This book may have no philosophical value whatever, but it has a great psychological value.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Just what is that?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You see, Dr. Stadler, people don’t want to think. And the deeper they get into trouble, the less they want to think. But by some sort of instinct, they feel that they ought to and it makes them feel guilty. So they’ll bless and follow anyone who gives them a justification for not thinking. Anyone who makes a virtue—a highly intellectual virtue—out of what they know to be their sin, their weakness and their guilt.”</div>
<div class="tx">“And you propose to pander to that?”</div>
<div class="tx">“That is the road to popularity.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why should you seek popularity?”</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Ferris’ eyes moved casually to Dr. Stadler’s face, as if by pure accident. “We are a public institution,” he answered evenly, “supported by public funds.”</div>
<div class="tx">“So you tell people that science is a futile fraud which ought to be abolished!”</div>
<div class="tx">“That is a conclusion which could be drawn, in logic, from my book. But that is not the conclusion they will draw.”</div>
<div class="tx">“And what about the disgrace to the Institute in the eyes of the men of intelligence, wherever such may be left?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why should we worry about them?”</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Stadler could have regarded the sentence as conceivable, had it been uttered with hatred, envy or malice; but the absence of any such emotion, the casual ease of the voice, an ease suggesting a chuckle, hit him like a moment’s glimpse of a realm that could not be taken as part of reality; the thing spreading down to his stomach was cold terror.</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you observe the reactions to my book, Dr. Stadler? It was received with considerable favor.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes—and <i>that</i> is what I find impossible to believe.” He had to speak, he had to speak as if this were a civilized discussion, he could not allow himself time to know what it was he had felt for a moment. “I am unable to understand the attention you received in all the reputable academic magazines and how they could permit themselves to discuss your book seriously. If Hugh Akston were around, no academic publication would have dared to treat this as a work admissible into the realm of philosophy.”</div>
<div class="tx">“He is not around.”</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Stadler felt that there were words which he was now called upon to pronounce—and he wished he could end this conversation before he discovered what they were.</div>
<div class="tx">“On the other hand,” said Dr. Ferris, “the ads for my book—oh, I’m sure you wouldn’t notice such things as ads—quote a letter of high praise which I received from Mr. Wesley Mouch.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who the hell is Mr. Wesley Mouch?”</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Ferris smiled. “In another year, even you won’t ask that question, Dr. Stadler. Let us put it this way: Mr. Mouch is the man who is rationing oil—for the time being.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then I suggest that you stick to your job. Deal with Mr. Mouch and leave him the realm of oil furnaces, but leave the realm of ideas to me.”</div>
<div class="tx">“It would be curious to try to formulate the line of demarcation,” said Dr. Ferris, in the tone of an idle academic remark. “But if we’re talking about my book, why, then we’re talking about the realm of public relations.” He turned to point solicitously at the mathematical formulas chalked on the blackboard. “Dr. Stadler, it would be disastrous if you allowed the realm of public relations to distract you from the work which you alone on earth are capable of doing.”</div>
<div class="tx">It was said with obsequious deference, and Dr. Stadler could not tell what made him hear in it the sentence: “Stick to your blackboard!” He felt a biting irritation and he switched it against himself, thinking angrily that he had to get rid of these suspicions.</div>
<div class="tx">“Public relations?” he said contemptuously. “I don’t see any practical  purpose in your book. I don’t see what it’s intended to accomplish.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Don’t you?” Dr. Ferris’ eyes flickered briefly to his face; the sparkle of insolence was too swift to be identified with certainty.</div>
<div class="tx">“I cannot permit myself to consider certain things as possible in a civilized society,” Dr. Stadler said sternly.</div>
<div class="tx">“That is admirably exact,” said Dr. Ferris cheerfully. “You cannot permit yourself.”</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Ferris rose, being first to indicate that the interview was ended. “Please call for me whenever anything occurs in this Institute to cause you discomfort, Dr. Stadler,” he said. “It is my privilege always to be at your service.”</div>
<div class="tx">Knowing that he had to assert his authority, smothering the shameful realization of the sort of substitute he was choosing, Dr. Stadler said imperiously, in a tone of sarcastic rudeness, “The next time I call for you, you’d better do something about that car of yours.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, Dr. Stadler. I shall make certain never to be late again, and I beg you to forgive me.” Dr. Ferris responded as if playing a part on cue; as if he were pleased that Dr. Stadler had learned, at last, the modem method of communication. “My car has been causing me a great deal of trouble, it’s falling to pieces, and I had ordered a new one sometime ago, the best one on the market, a Hammond convertible—but Lawrence Hammond went out of business last week, without reason or warning, so now I’m stuck. Those bastards seem to be vanishing somewhere. Something will have to be done about it.”</div>
<div class="tx">When Ferris had gone, Dr. Stadler sat at his desk, his shoulders shrinking together, conscious only of a desperate wish not to be seen by anyone. In the fog of the pain which he would not define, there was also the desperate feeling that no one—no one of those he valued—would ever wish to see him again.</div>
<div class="tx">He knew the words which he had not uttered. He had not said that he would denounce the book in public and repudiate it in the name of the Institute. He had not said it, because he had been afraid to discover that the threat would leave Ferris unmoved, that Ferris was safe, that the word of Dr. Robert Stadler had no power any longer. And while he told himself that he would consider later the question of making a public protest, he knew that he would not make it.</div>
<div class="tx">He picked up the book and let it drop into the wastebasket.</div>
<div class="tx">A face came to his mind, suddenly and clearly, as if he were seeing the purity of its every line, a young face he had not permitted himself to recall for years. He thought: No, he has not read this book, he won’t see it, he’s dead, he must have died long ago.... The sharp pain was the shock of discovering simultaneously that this was the man he longed to see more than any other being in the world—and that he had to hope that this man was dead.</div>
<div class="tx">He did not know why—when the telephone rang and his secretary told him that Miss Dagny Taggart was on the line—why he seized the  receiver with eagerness and noticed that his hand was trembling. She would never want to see him again, he had thought for over a year. He heard her clear, impersonal voice asking for an appointment to see him. “Yes, Miss Taggart, certainly, yes, indeed.... Monday morning? Yes—look, Miss Taggart, I have an engagement in New York today, I could drop in at your office this afternoon, if you wish.... No, no -no trouble at all, I’ll be delighted.... This afternoon, Miss Taggart, about two—I mean, about four o‘clock.”</div>
<div class="tx">He had no engagement in New York. He did not give himself time to know what had prompted him to do it. He was smiling eagerly, looking at a patch of sunlight on a distant hill.</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="044" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_044_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">Dagny drew a black line across Train Number 93 on the schedule, and felt a moment’s desolate satisfaction in noting that she did it calmly. It was an action which she had had to perform many times in the last six months. It had been hard, at first; it was becoming easier. The day would come, she thought, when she would be able to deliver that death stroke even without the small salute of an effort. Train Number 93 was a freight that had earned its living by carrying supplies to Hammondsville, Colorado.</div>
<div class="tx">She knew what steps would come next: first, the death of the special freights—then the shrinking in the number of boxcars for Hammondsville, attached, like poor relatives, to the rear end of freights bound for other towns—then the gradual cutting of the stops at Hammondsville Station from the schedules of the passenger trains—then the day when she would strike Hammondsville, Colorado, off the map. That had been the progression of Wyatt Junction and of the town called Stockton.</div>
<div class="tx">She knew—once word was received that Lawrence Hammond had retired—that it was useless to wait, to hope and to wonder whether his cousin, his lawyer or a committee of local citizens would reopen the plant. She knew it was time to start cutting the schedules.</div>
<div class="tx">It had lasted less than six months after Ellis Wyatt had gone—that period which a columnist had gleefully called “the field day of the little fellow.” Every oil operator in the country, who owned three wells and whined that Ellis Wyatt left him no chance of livelihood, had rushed to fill the hole which Wyatt had left wide open. They formed leagues, cooperatives, associations; they pooled their resources and their letter-heads. “The little fellow’s day in the sun,” the columnist had said. Their sun had been the flames that twisted through the derricks of Wyatt Oil. In its glare, they made the kind of fortunes they had dreamed about, fortunes requiring no competence or effort. Then their biggest customers, such as power companies, who drank oil by the trainful and would make no allowances for human frailty, began to convert to coal -and the smaller customers, who were more tolerant, began to go out  of business—the boys in Washington imposed rationing on oil and an emergency tax on employers to support the unemployed oil field workers—then a few of the big oil companies closed down—then the little fellows in the sun discovered that a drilling bit which had cost a hundred dollars, now cost them five hundred, there being no market for oil field equipment, and the suppliers having to earn on one drill what they had earned on five, or perish—then the pipe lines began to close, there being no one able to pay for their upkeep—then the railroads were granted permission to raise their freight rates, there being little oil to carry and the cost of running tank trains having crushed two small lines out of existence—and when the sun went down, they saw that the operating costs, which had once permitted them to exist on their sixty-acre fields, had been made possible by the miles of Wyatt’s hillside and had gone in the same coils of smoke. Not until their fortunes had vanished and their pumps had stopped, did the little fellows realize that no business in the country could afford to buy oil at the price it would now take them to produce it. Then the boys in Washington granted subsidies to the oil operators, but not all of the oil operators had friends in Washington, and there followed a situation which no one cared to examine too closely or to discuss.</div>
<div class="tx">Andrew Stockton had been in the sort of position which most of the businessmen envied. The rush to convert to coal had descended upon his shoulders like a weight of gold: he had kept his plant working around the clock, running a race with next winter’s blizzards, casting parts for coal-burning stoves and furnaces. There were not many dependable foundries left; he had become one of the main pillars supporting the cellars and kitchens of the country. The pillar collapsed without warning. Andrew Stockton announced that he was retiring, closed his plant and vanished. He left no word on what he wished to be done with the plant or whether his relatives had the right to reopen it.</div>
<div class="tx">There still were cars on the roads of the country, but they moved like travelers in the desert, who ride past the warning skeletons of horses bleached by the sun: they moved past the skeletons of cars that had collapsed on duty and had been left in the ditches by the side of the road. People were not buying cars any longer, and the automobile factories were closing. But there were men still able to get oil, by means of friendships that nobody cared to question. These men bought cars at any price demanded. Lights flooded the mountains of Colorado from the great windows of the plant, where the assembly belts of Lawrence Hammond poured trucks and cars to the sidings of Taggart Transcontinental. The word that Lawrence Hammond had retired came when least expected, brief and sudden like the single stroke of a bell in a heavy stillness. A committee of local citizens was now broadcasting appeals on the radio, begging Lawrence Hammond, wherever he was, to give them permission to reopen his plant. There was no answer.</div>
<div class="tx">She had screamed when Ellis Wyatt went; she had gasped when Andrew Stockton retired; when she heard that Lawrence Hammond had quit, she asked impassively, “Who’s next?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, Miss Taggart, I can’t explain it,” the sister of Andrew Stockton had told her on her last trip to Colorado, two months ago. “He never said a word to me and I don’t even know whether he’s dead or living, same as Ellis Wyatt. No, nothing special had happened the day before he quit. I remember only that some man came to see him on that last evening. A stranger I’d never seen before. They talked late into the night—when I went to sleep, the light was still burning in Andrew’s study.”</div>
<div class="tx">People were silent in the towns of Colorado. Dagny had seen the way they walked in the streets, past their small drugstores, hardware stores and grocery markets: as if they hoped that the motions of their jobs would save them from looking ahead at the future. She, too, had walked through those streets, trying not to lift her head, not to see the ledges of sooted rock and twisted steel, which had been the Wyatt oil fields. They could be seen from many of the towns; when she had looked ahead, she had seen them in the distance.</div>
<div class="tx">One well, on the crest of the hill, was still burning. Nobody had been able to extinguish it. She had seen it from the streets: a spurt of fire twisting convulsively against the sky, as if trying to tear loose. She had seen it at night, across the distance of a hundred clear, black miles, from the window of a train: a small, violent flame, waving in the wind. People called it Wyatt’s Torch.</div>
<div class="tx">The longest train on the John Galt Line had forty cars; the fastest ran at fifty miles an hour. The engines had to be spared: they were coal-burning engines, long past their age of retirement. Jim obtained the oil for the Diesels that pulled the Comet and a few of their transcontinental freights. The only source of fuel she could count on and deal with was Ken Danagger of Danagger Coal in Pennsylvania.</div>
<div class="tx">Empty trains clattered through the four states that were tied, as neighbors, to the throat of Colorado. They carried a few carloads of sheep, some corn, some melons and an occasional farmer with an overdressed family, who had friends in Washington. Jim had obtained a subsidy from Washington for every train that was run, not as a profit-making carrier, but as a service of “public equality.”</div>
<div class="tx">It took every scrap of her energy to keep trains running through the sections where they were still needed, in the areas that were still producing. But on the balance sheets of Taggart Transcontinental, the checks of Jim’s subsidies for empty trains bore larger figures than the profit brought by the best freight train of the busiest industrial division.</div>
<div class="tx">Jim boasted that this had been the most prosperous six months in Taggart history. Listed as profit, on the glossy pages of his report to the stockholders, was the money he had not earned—the subsidies for empty trains; and the money he did not own—the sums that should have gone to pay the interest and the retirement of Taggart bonds, the  debt which, by the will of Wesley Mouch, he had been permitted not to pay. He boasted about the greater volume of freight carried by Taggart trains in Arizona—where Dan Conway had closed the last of the Phoenix-Durango and retired; and in Minnesota—where Paul Larkin was shipping iron ore by rail, and the last of the ore boats on the Great Lakes had gone out of existence.</div>
<div class="tx">“You have always considered money-making as such an important virtue,” Jim had said to her with an odd half-smile. “Well, it seems to me that I’m better at it than you are.”</div>
<div class="tx">Nobody professed to understand the question of the frozen railroad bonds; perhaps, because everybody understood it too well. At first, there had been signs of a panic among the bondholders and of a dangerous indignation among the public. Then, Wesley Mouch had issued another directive, which ruled that people could get their bonds “defrozen” upon a plea of “essential need”: the government would purchase the bonds, if it found the proof of the need satisfactory. There were three questions that no one answered or asked: “What constituted proof?” “What constituted need?” “Essential—to whom?”</div>
<div class="tx">Then it became bad manners to discuss why one man received the grant defreezing his money, while another had been refused. People turned away in mouth-pinched silence, if anybody asked a “why?” One was supposed to describe, not to explain, to catalogue facts, not to evaluate them: Mr. Smith had been defrozen, Mr. Jones had not; that was all. And when Mr. Jones committed suicide, people said, “Well, I don’t know, if he’d really needed his money, the government would have given it to him, but some men are just greedy.”</div>
<div class="tx">One was not supposed to speak about the men who, having been refused, sold their bonds for one-third of the value to other men who possessed needs which, miraculously, made thirty-three frozen cents melt into a whole dollar; or about a new profession practiced by bright young boys just out of college, who called themselves “defreezers” and offered their services “to help you draft your application in the proper modern terms.” The boys had friends in Washington.</div>
<div class="tx">Looking at the Taggart rail from the platform of some country station, she had found herself feeling, not the brilliant pride she had once felt, but a foggy, guilty shame, as if some foul kind of rust had grown on the metal, and worse: as if the rust had a tinge of blood. But then, in the concourse of the Terminal, she looked at the statue of Nat Taggart and thought: It was your rail, you made it, you fought for it, you were not stopped by fear or by loathing—I won’t surrender it to the men of blood and rust—and I’m the only one left to guard it.</div>
<div class="tx">She had not given up her quest for the man who invented the motor. It was the only part of her work that made her able to bear the rest. It was the only goal in sight that gave meaning to her struggle. There were times when she wondered why she wanted to rebuild that motor. What for?—some voice seemed to ask her. Because I’m still alive, she  answered. But her quest had remained futile. Her two engineers had found nothing in Wisconsin. She had sent them to search through the country for men who had worked for Twentieth Century, to learn the name of the inventor. They had learned nothing. She had sent them to search through the files of the Patent Office; no patent for the motor had ever been registered.</div>
<div class="tx">The only remnant of her personal quest was the stub of the cigarette with the dollar sign. She had forgotten it, until a recent evening, when she had found it in a drawer of her desk and given it to her friend at the cigar counter of the concourse. The old man had been very astonished, as he examined the stub, holding it cautiously between two fingers; he had never heard of such a brand and wondered how he could have missed it. “Was it of good quality, Miss Taggart?” “The best I’ve ever smoked.” He had shaken his head, puzzled. He had promised to discover where those cigarettes were made and to get her a carton.</div>
<div class="tx">She had tried to find a scientist able to attempt the reconstruction of the motor. She had interviewed the men recommended to her as the best in their field. The first one, after studying the remnants of the motor and of the manuscript, had declared, in the tone of a drill sergeant, that the thing could not work, had never worked and he would prove that no such motor could ever be made to work. The second one had drawled, in the tone of an answer to a boring imposition, that he did not know whether it could be done or not and did not care to find out. The third had said, his voice belligerently insolent, that he would attempt the task on a ten-year contract at twenty-five thousand dollars a year—“After all, Miss Taggart, if you expect to make huge profits on that motor, it’s you who should pay for the gamble of my time.” The fourth, who was the youngest, had looked at her silently for a moment and the lines of his face had slithered from blankness into a suggestion of contempt. “You know, Miss Taggart, I don’t think that such a motor should ever be made, even if somebody did learn how to make it. It would be so superior to anything we’ve got that it would be unfair to lesser scientists, because it would leave no field for their achievements and abilities. I don’t think that the strong should have the right to wound the self-esteem of the weak.” She had ordered him out of her office, and had sat in incredulous horror before the fact that the most vicious statement she had ever heard had been uttered in a tone of moral righteousness.</div>
<div class="tx">The decision to speak to Dr. Robert Stadler had been her last recourse.</div>
<div class="tx">She had forced herself to call him, against the resistance of some immovable point within her that felt like brakes slammed tight. She had argued against herself. She had thought: I deal with men like Jim and Orren Boyle—his guilt is less than theirs—why can’t I speak to him? She had found no answer, only a stubborn sense of reluctance, only the feeling that of all the men on earth, Dr. Robert Stadler was the one she must not call.</div>
<div class="tx">As she sat at her desk, over the schedules of the John Gait Line, waiting for Dr. Stadler to come, she wondered why no first-rate talent had risen in the field of science for years. She was unable to look for an answer. She was looking at the black line which was the corpse of Train Number 93 on the schedule before her.</div>
<div class="tx">A train has the two great attributes of life, she thought, motion and purpose; this had been like a living entity, but now it was only a number of dead freight cars and engines. Don’t give yourself time to feel, she thought, dismember the carcass as fast as possible, the engines are needed all over the system, Ken Danagger in Pennsylvania needs trains, more trains, if only—</div>
<div class="tx">“Dr. Robert Stadler,” said the voice of the interoffice communicator on her desk.</div>
<div class="tx">He came in, smiling; the smile seemed to underscore his words: “Miss Taggart, would you care to believe how helplessly glad I am to see you again?”</div>
<div class="tx">She did not smile, she looked gravely courteous as she answered, “It was very kind of you to come here.” She bowed, her slender figure standing tautly straight but for the slow, formal movement of her head.</div>
<div class="tx">“What if I confessed that all I needed was some plausible excuse in order to come? Would it astonish you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I would try not to overtax your courtesy.” She did not smile. “Please sit down, Dr. Stadler.”</div>
<div class="tx">He looked brightly around him. “I’ve never seen the office of a railroad executive. I didn’t know it would be so ... so solemn a place. Is that in the nature of the job?”</div>
<div class="tx">“The matter on which I’d like to ask your advice is far removed from the field of your interests, Dr. Stadler. You may think it odd that I should call on you. Please allow me to explain my reason.”</div>
<div class="tx">“The fact that you wished to call on me is a fully sufficient reason. If I can be of any service to you, any service whatever, I don’t know what would please me more at this moment.” His smile had an attractive quality, the smile of a man of the world who used it, not to cover his words, but to stress the audacity of expressing a sincere emotion.</div>
<div class="tx">“My problem is a matter of technology,” she said, in the clear, expressionless tone of a young mechanic discussing a difficult assignment. “I fully realize your contempt for that branch of science. I do not expect you to solve my problem—it is not the kind of work which you do or care about. I should like only to submit the problem to you, and then I’ll have just two questions to ask you. I had to call on you, because it is a matter that involves someone’s mind, a very great mind, and”—she spoke impersonally, in the manner of rendering exact justice—“and you are the only great mind left in this field.”</div>
<div class="tx">She could not tell why her words hit him as they did. She saw the stillness of his face, the sudden earnestness of the eyes, a strange earnestness that seemed eager and almost pleading, then she heard his  voice come gravely, as if from under the pressure of some emotion that made it sound simple and humble:</div>
<div class="tx">“What is your problem, Miss Taggart?”</div>
<div class="tx">She told him about the motor and the place where she had found it; she told him that it had proved impossible to learn the name of the inventor; she did not mention the details of her quest. She handed him photographs of the motor and the remnant of the manuscript.</div>
<div class="tx">She watched him as he read. She saw the professional assurance in the swift, scanning motion of his eyes, at first, then the pause, then the growing intentness, then a movement of his lips which, from another man, would have been a whistle or a gasp. She saw him stop for long minutes and look off, as if his mind were racing over countless sudden trails, trying to follow them all—she saw him leaf back through the pages, then stop, then force himself to read on, as if he were torn between his eagerness to continue and his eagerness to seize all the possibilities breaking open before his vision. She saw his silent excitement, she knew that he had forgotten her office, her existence, everything but the sight of an achievement—and in tribute to his being capable of such reaction, she wished it were possible for her to like Dr. Robert Stadler.</div>
<div class="tx">They had been silent for over an hour, when he finished and looked up at her. “But this is extraordinary!” he said in the joyous, astonished tone of announcing some news she had not expected.</div>
<div class="tx">She wished she could smile in answer and grant him the comradeship of a joy celebrated together, but she merely nodded and said coldly, “Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But, Miss Taggart, this is tremendous!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes. ”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you say it’s a matter of technology? It’s more, much, much more than that. The pages where he writes about his converter—you can see what premise he’s speaking from. He arrived at some new concept of energy. He discarded all our standard assumptions, according to which his motor would have been impossible. He formulated a new premise of his own and he solved the secret of converting static energy into kinetic power. Do you know what <i>that</i> means? Do you realize what a feat of pure, abstract science he had to perform before he could make his motor?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who?” she asked quietly.</div>
<div class="tx">“I beg your pardon?”</div>
<div class="tx">“That was the first of the two questions I wanted to ask you, Dr. Stadler: can you think of any young scientist you might have known ten years ago, who would have been able to do this?”</div>
<div class="tx">He paused, astonished; he had not had time to wonder about that question. “No,” he said slowly, frowning, “no, I can’t think of anyone. ... And that’s odd ... because an ability of this kind couldn’t have passed unnoticed anywhere ... somebody would have called him to  my attention ... they always sent promising young physicists to me. ... Did you say you found this in the research laboratory of a plain, commercial motor factory?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s odd. What was he doing in such a place?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Designing a motor.”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s what I mean. A man with the genius of a great scientist, who chose to be a commercial inventor? I find it outrageous. He wanted a motor, and he quietly performed a major revolution in the science of energy, just as a means to an end, and he didn’t bother to publish his findings, but went right on making his motor. Why did he want to waste his mind on practical appliances?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Perhaps because he liked living on this earth,” she said involuntarily.</div>
<div class="tx">“I beg your pardon?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, I ... I’m sorry, Dr. Stadler. I did not intend to discuss any ... irrelevant subject.”</div>
<div class="tx">He was looking off, pursuing his own course of thought. “Why didn’t he come to me? Why wasn’t he in some great scientific establishment where he belonged? If he had the brains to achieve this, surely he had the brains to know the importance of what he had done. Why didn’t he publish a paper on his definition of energy? I can see the general direction he’d taken, but God damn him!—the most important pages are missing, the statement isn’t here! Surely somebody around him should have known enough to announce his work to the whole world of science. Why didn’t they? How could they abandon, just abandon, a thing of this kind?”</div>
<div class="tx">“These are the questions to which I found no answers.”</div>
<div class="tx">“And besides, from the purely practical aspect, why was that motor left in a junk pile? You’d think any greedy fool of an industrialist would have grabbed it in order to make a fortune. No intelligence was needed to see its commercial value.”</div>
<div class="tx">She smiled for the first time—a smile ugly with bitterness; she said nothing.</div>
<div class="tx">“You found it impossible to trace the inventor?” he asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“Completely impossible—so far.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you think that he is still alive?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have reason to think that he is. But I can’t be sure.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Suppose I tried to advertise for him?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. Don’t.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But if I were to place ads in scientific publications and have Dr. Ferris”—he stopped; he saw her glance at him as swiftly as he glanced at her; she said nothing, but she held his glance; he looked away and finished the sentence coldly and firmly—“and have Dr. Ferris broadcast on the radio that <i>I</i> wish to see him, would he refuse to come?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, Dr. Stadler, I think he would refuse.”</div>
<div class="tx">He was not looking at her. She saw the faint tightening of his facial muscles and, simultaneously, the look of something going slack in the lines of his face; she could not tell what sort of light was dying within him nor what made her think of the death of a light.</div>
<div class="tx">He tossed the manuscript down on the desk with a casual, contemptuous movement of his wrist. “Those men who do not mind being practical enough to sell their brains for money, ought to acquire a little knowledge of the conditions of practical reality.”</div>
<div class="tx">He looked at her with a touch of defiance, as if waiting for an angry answer. But her answer was worse than anger: her face remained expressionless, as if the truth or falsehood of his convictions were of no concern to her any longer. She said politely, “The second question I wanted to ask you was whether you would be kind enough to tell me the name of any physicist you know who, in your judgment, would possess the ability to attempt the reconstruction of this motor.”</div>
<div class="tx">He looked at her and chuckled; it was a sound of pain. “Have you been tortured by it, too, Miss Taggart? By the impossibility of finding any sort of intelligence anywhere?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have interviewed some physicists who were highly recommended to me and I have found them to be hopeless.”</div>
<div class="tx">He leaned forward eagerly. “Miss Taggart,” he asked, “did you call on me because you trusted the integrity of my scientific judgment?” The question was a naked plea.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes,” she answered evenly, “I trusted the integrity of your scientific judgment.”</div>
<div class="tx">He leaned back; he looked as if some hidden smile were smoothing the tension away from his face. “I wish I could help you,” he said, as to a comrade. “I most selfishly wish I could help you, because, you see, this has been my hardest problem—trying to find men of talent for my own staff. Talent, hell! I’d be satisfied with just a semblance of promise —but the men they send me couldn’t be honestly said to possess the potentiality of developing into decent garage mechanics. I don’t know whether I am getting older and more demanding, or whether the human race is degenerating, but the world didn’t seem to be so barren of intelligence in my youth. Today, if you saw the kind of men I’ve had to interview, you‘d—”</div>
<div class="tx">He stopped abruptly, as if at a sudden recollection. He remained silent; he seemed to be considering something he knew, but did not wish to tell her; she became certain of it, when he concluded brusquely, in that tone of resentment which conceals an evasion, “No, I don’t know anyone I’d care to recommend to you.”</div>
<div class="tx">“This was all I wanted to ask you, Dr. Stadler,” she said. “Thank you for giving me your time.”</div>
<div class="tx">He sat silently still for a moment, as if he could not bring himself to leave.</div>
<div class="tx">“Miss Taggart,” he asked, “could you show me the actual motor itself?”</div>
<div class="tx">She looked at him, astonished. “Why, yes ... if you wish. But it’s in an underground vault, down in our Terminal tunnels.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t mind, if you wouldn’t mind taking me down there. I have no special motive. It’s only my personal curiosity. I would like to see it—that’s all.”</div>
<div class="tx">When they stood in the granite vault, over a glass case containing a shape of broken metal, he took off his hat with a slow, absent movement—and she could not tell whether it was the routine gesture of remembering that he was in a room with a lady, or the gesture of baring one’s head over a coffin.</div>
<div class="tx">They stood in silence, in the glare of a single light refracted from the glass surface to their faces. Train wheels were clicking in the distance, and it seemed at times as if a sudden, sharper jolt of vibration were about to awaken an answer from the corpse in the glass case.</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s so wonderful,” said Dr. Stadler, his voice low. “It’s so wonderful to see a great, new, crucial idea which is not mine!”</div>
<div class="tx">She looked at him, wishing she could believe that she understood him correctly. He spoke, in passionate sincerity, discarding convention, discarding concern for whether it was proper to let her hear the confession of his pain, seeing nothing but the face of a woman who was able to understand:</div>
<div class="tx">“Miss Taggart, do you know the hallmark of the second-rater? It’s resentment of another man’s achievement. Those touchy mediocrities who sit trembling lest someone’s work prove greater than their own—they have no inkling of the loneliness that comes when you reach the top. The loneliness for an equal—for a mind to respect and an achievement to admire. They bare their teeth at you from out of their rat holes, thinking that you take pleasure in letting your brilliance dim them—while you’d give a year of your life to see a flicker of talent anywhere among them. They envy achievement, and their dream of greatness is a world where all men have become their acknowledged inferiors. They don’t know that that dream is the infallible proof of mediocrity, because that sort of world is what the man of achievement would not be able to bear. They have no way of knowing what he feels when surrounded by inferiors—hatred? no, not hatred, but boredom—the terrible, hopeless, draining, paralyzing boredom. Of what account are praise and adulation from men whom you don’t respect? Have you ever felt the longing for someone you could admire? For something, not to look down at, but up to?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’ve felt it all my life,” she said. It was an answer she could not refuse him.</div>
<div class="tx">“I know,” he said—and there was beauty in the impersonal gentleness of his voice. “I knew it the first time I spoke to you. That was why I came today—” He stopped for the briefest instant, but she did not  answer the appeal and he finished with the same quiet gentleness, “Well, that was why I wanted to see the motor.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I understand,” she said softly; the tone of her voice was the only form of acknowledgment she could grant him.</div>
<div class="tx">“Miss Taggart,” he said, his eyes lowered, looking at the glass case, “I know a man who might be able to undertake the reconstruction of that motor. He would not work for me—so he is probably the kind of man you want.”</div>
<div class="tx">But by the time he raised his head—and before he saw the look of admiration in her eyes, the open look he had begged for, the look of forgiveness—he destroyed his single moment’s atonement by adding in a voice of drawing-room sarcasm, “Apparently, the young man had no desire to work for the good of society or the welfare of science. He told me that he would not take a government job. I presume he wanted the bigger salary he could hope to obtain from a private employer.”</div>
<div class="tx">He turned away, not to see the look that was fading from her face, not to let himself know its meaning. “Yes,” she said, her voice hard, “he is probably the kind of man I want.”</div>
<div class="tx">“He’s a young physicist from the Utah Institute of Technology,” he said dryly. “His name is Quentin Daniels. A friend of mine sent him to me a few months ago. He came to see me, but he would not take the job I offered. I wanted him on my staff. He had the mind of a scientist. I don’t know whether he can succeed with your motor, but at least he has the ability to attempt it. I believe you can still reach him at the Utah Institute of Technology. I don’t know what he’s doing there now—they closed the Institute a year ago.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Thank you, Dr. Stadler. I shall get in touch with him.”</div>
<div class="tx">“If ... if you want me to, I’ll be glad to help him with the theoretical part of it. I’m going to do some work myself, starting from the leads of that manuscript. I’d like to find the cardinal secret of energy that its author had found. It’s his basic principle that we must discover. If we succeed, Mr. Daniels may finish the job, as far as your motor is concerned.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I will appreciate any help you may care to give me, Dr. Stadler.”</div>
<div class="tx">They walked silently through the dead tunnels of the Terminal, down the ties of a rusted track under a string of blue lights, to the distant glow of the platforms.</div>
<div class="tx">At the mouth of the tunnel, they saw a man kneeling on the track, hammering at a switch with the unrhythmical exasperation of uncertainty. Another man stood watching him impatiently.</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, what’s the matter with the damn thing?” asked the watcher.</div>
<div class="tx">“Don’t know.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’ve been at it for an hour.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yeah.”</div>
<div class="tx">“How long is it going to take?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who is John Galt?”</div>
<div class="tx">Dr. Stadler winced. They had gone past the men, when he said, “I don’t like that expression.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don‘t, either,” she answered.</div>
<div class="tx">“Where did it come from?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Nobody knows.”</div>
<div class="tx">They were silent, then he said, “I knew a John Galt once. Only he died long ago.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who was he?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I used to think that he was still alive. But now I’m certain that he must have died. He had such a mind that, had he lived, the whole world would have been talking of him by now.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But the whole world is talking of him.”</div>
<div class="tx">He stopped still. “Yes ...” he said slowly, staring at a thought that had never struck him before, “yes ... Why?” The word was heavy with the sound of terror.</div>
<div class="tx">“Who was he, Dr. Stadler?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why are they talking of him?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who was he?”</div>
<div class="tx">He shook his head with a shudder and said sharply, “It’s just a coincidence. The name is not uncommon at all. It’s a meaningless coincidence. It has no connection with the man I knew. That man is dead.”</div>
<div class="tx">He did not permit himself to know the full meaning of the words he added:</div>
<div class="tx">“He has to be dead.”</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="045" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_045_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">The order that lay on his desk was marked “Confidential ... Emergency ... Priority ... Essential need certified by office of Top Co-ordinator ... for the account of Project X”—and demanded that he sell ten thousand tons of Rearden Metal to the State Science Institute.</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden read it and glanced up at the superintendent of his mills who stood before him without moving. The superintendent had come in and put the order down on his desk without a word.</div>
<div class="tx">“I thought you’d want to see it,” he said, in answer to Rearden’s glance.</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden pressed a button, summoning Miss Ives. He handed the order to her and said, “Send this back to wherever it came from. Tell them that I will not sell any Rearden Metal to the State Science Institute.”</div>
<div class="tx">Gwen Ives and the superintendent looked at him, at each other and back at him again; what he saw in their eyes was congratulation.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, Mr. Rearden,” Gwen Ives said formally, taking the slip as if it were any other kind of business paper. She bowed and left the room. The superintendent followed.</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden smiled faintly, in greeting to what they felt. He felt nothing about that paper or its possible consequences.</div>
<div class="tx">By a sort of inner convulsion—which had been like tearing a plug out to cut off the current of his emotions—he had told himself six months ago: Act first, keep the mills going, feel later. It had made him able to watch dispassionately the working of the Fair Share Law.</div>
<div class="tx">Nobody had known how that law was to be observed. First, he had been told that he could not produce Rearden Metal in an amount greater than the tonnage of the best special alloy, other than steel, produced by Orren Boyle. But Orren Boyle’s best special alloy was some cracking mixture that no one cared to buy. Then he had been told that he could produce Rearden Metal in the amount that Orren Boyle  <i>could have</i> produced, if he could have produced it. Nobody had known how this was to be determined. Somebody in Washington had announced a figure, naming a number of tons per year, giving no reasons. Everybody had let it go at that.</div>
<div class="tx">He had not known how to give every consumer who demanded it an equal share of Rearden Metal. The waiting list of orders could not be filled in three years, even had he been permitted to work at full capacity. New orders were coming in daily. They were not orders any longer, in the old, honorable sense of trade; they were demands. The law provided that he could be sued by any consumer who failed to receive his fair share of Rearden Metal.</div>
<div class="tx">Nobody had known how to determine what constituted a fair share of what amount. Then a bright young boy just out of college had been sent to him from Washington, as Deputy Director of Distribution. After many telephone conferences with the capital, the boy announced that customers would get five hundred tons of the Metal each, in the order of the dates of their applications. Nobody had argued against his figure. There was no way to form an argument; the figure could have been one pound or one million tons, with the same validity. The boy had established an office at the Rearden mills, where four girls took applications for shares of Rearden Metal. At the present rate of the mills’ production, the applications extended well into the next century.</div>
<div class="tx">Five hundred tons of Rearden Metal could not provide three miles of rail for Taggart Transcontinental; it could not provide the bracing for one of Ken Danagger’s coal mines. The largest industries, Rearden’s best customers, were denied the use of his Metal. But golf clubs made of Rearden Metal were suddenly appearing on the market, as well as coffee pots, garden tools and bathroom faucets. Ken Danagger, who had seen the value of the Metal and had dared to order it against a fury of public opinion, was not permitted to obtain it; his order had been left unfilled, cut off without warning by the new laws. Mr. Mowen, who had betrayed Taggart Transcontinental in its most dangerous hour, was now making switches of Rearden Metal and selling them to the Atlantic Southern. Rearden looked on, his emotions plugged out.</div>
<div class="tx">He turned away, without a word, when anybody mentioned to him what everybody knew: the quick fortunes that were being made on  Rearden Metal. “Well, no,” people said in drawing rooms, “you musn’t call it a black market, because it isn‘t, really. Nobody is selling the <i>Metal</i> illegally. They’re just selling their right to it. Not selling really, just pooling their shares.” He did not want to know the insect intricacy of the deals through which the “shares” were sold and pooled—nor how a manufacturer in Virginia had produced, in two months, five thousand tons of castings made of Rearden Metal—nor what man in Washington was that manufacturer’s unlisted partner. He knew that their profit on a ton of Rearden Metal was five times larger than his own. He said nothing. Everybody had a right to the Metal, except himself.</div>
<div class="tx">The young boy from Washington—whom the steel workers had nicknamed the Wet Nurse—hung around Rearden with a primitive, astonished curiosity which, incredibly, was a form of admiration. Rearden watched him with disgusted amusement. The boy had no inkling of any concept of morality; it had been bred out of him by his college; this had left him an odd frankness, naive and cynical at once, like the innocence of a savage.</div>
<div class="tx">“You despise me, Mr. Rearden,” he had declared once, suddenly and without any resentment. “That’s impractical.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why is it impractical?” Rearden had asked.</div>
<div class="tx">The boy had looked puzzled and had found no answer. He never had an answer to any “why?” He spoke in flat assertions. He would say about people, “He’s old-fashioned,” “He’s unreconstructed,” “He’s unadjusted,” without hesitation or explanation; he would also say, while being a graduate in metallurgy, “Iron smelting, I think, seems to require a high temperature.” He uttered nothing but uncertain opinions about physical nature—and nothing but categorical imperatives about men.</div>
<div class="tx">“Mr. Rearden,” he had said once, “if you feel you’d like to hand out more of the Metal to friends of yours—I mean, in bigger hauls—it could be arranged, you know. Why don’t we apply for a special permission on the ground of essential need? I’ve got a few friends in Washington. Your friends are pretty important people, big businessmen, so it wouldn’t be difficult to get away with the essential need dodge. Of course, there would be a few expenses. For things in Washington. You know how it is, things always occasion expenses.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What things?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You understand what I mean.”</div>
<div class="tx">“No,” Rearden had said, “I don’t. Why don’t you explain it to me?”</div>
<div class="tx">The boy had looked at him uncertainly, weighed it in his mind, then come out with: “It’s bad psychology.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What is?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You know, Mr. Rearden, it’s not necessary to use such words as that.”</div>
<div class="tx">“As what?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Words are relative. They’re only symbols. If we don’t use ugly symbols, we won’t have any ugliness. Why do you want me to say things one way, when I’ve already said them another?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Which way do I want you to say them?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why do you want me to?”</div>
<div class="tx">“For the same reason that you don’t.”</div>
<div class="tx">The boy had remained silent for a moment, then had said, “You know, Mr. Rearden, there are no absolute standards. We can’t go by rigid principles, we’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to adjust to the reality of the day and act on the expediency of the moment.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Run along, punk. Go and try to pour a ton of steel without rigid principles, on the expediency of the moment.”</div>
<div class="tx">A strange sense, which was almost a sense of style, made Rearden feel contempt for the boy, but no resentment. The boy seemed to fit the spirit of the events around them. It was as if they were being carried back across a long span of centuries to the age where the boy had belonged, but he, Rearden, had not. Instead of building new furnaces, thought Rearden, he was now running a losing race to keep the old ones going; instead of starting new ventures, new research, new experiments in the use of Rearden Metal, he was spending the whole of his energy on a quest for sources of iron ore: like the men at the dawn of the Iron Age—he thought—but with less hope.</div>
<div class="tx">He tried to avoid these thoughts. He had to stand on guard against his own feeling—as if some part of him had become a stranger that had to be kept numb, and his will had to be its constant, watchful anesthetic. That part was an unknown of which he knew only that he must never see its root and never give it voice. He had lived through one dangerous moment which he could not allow to return.</div>
<div class="tx">It was the moment when—alone in his office, on a winter evening, held paralyzed by a newspaper spread on his desk with a long column of directives on the front page—he had heard on the radio the news of Ellis Wyatt’s flaming oil fields. Then, his first reaction—before any thought of the future, any sense of disaster, any shock, terror or protest -had been to burst out laughing. He had laughed in triumph, in deliverance, in a spurting, living exultation—and the words which he had not pronounced, but felt, were: God bless you, Ellis, whatever you’re doing!</div>
<div class="tx">When he had grasped the implications of his laughter, he had known that he was now condemned to constant vigilance against himself. Like the survivor of a heart attack, he knew that he had had a warning and that he carried within him a danger that could strike him at any moment.</div>
<div class="tx">He had held it off, since then. He had kept an even, cautious, severely controlled pace in his inner steps. But it had come close to him for a moment, once again. When he had looked at the order of the State Science Institute on his desk, it had seemed to him that the glow  moving over the paper did not come from the furnaces outside, but from the flames of a burning oil field.</div>
<div class="tx">“Mr. Rearden,” said the Wet Nurse, when he heard about the rejected order, “you shouldn’t have done that.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why not?”</div>
<div class="tx">“There’s going to be trouble.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What kind of trouble?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s a government order. You can’t reject a government order.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why can’t I?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s an Essential Need project, and secret, too. It’s very important.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What kind of a project is it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know. It’s secret.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then how do you know it’s important?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It said so.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who said so?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You can’t doubt such a thing as that, Mr. Rearden!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why can’t I?”</div>
<div class="tx">“But you can’t.”</div>
<div class="tx">“If I can‘t, then that would make it an absolute and you said there aren’t any absolutes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s different.”</div>
<div class="tx">“How is it different?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s the government.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You mean, there aren’t any absolutes except the government?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I mean, if they say it’s important, then it is.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t want you to get in trouble, Mr. Rearden, and you’re going to, sure as hell. You ask too many why’s. Now why do you do that?”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden glanced at him and chuckled. The boy noticed his own words and grinned sheepishly, but he looked unhappy.</div>
<div class="tx">The man who came to see Rearden a week later was youngish and slenderish, but neither as young nor as slender as he tried to make himself appear. He wore civilian clothes and the leather leggings of a traffic cop. Rearden could not quite get it clear whether he came from the State Science Institute or from Washington.</div>
<div class="tx">“I understand that you refused to sell metal to the State Science Institute, Mr. Rearden,” he said in a soft, confidential tone of voice.</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s right,” said Rearden.</div>
<div class="tx">“But wouldn’t that constitute a willful disobedience of the law?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s for you to interpret.”</div>
<div class="tx">“May I ask your reason?”</div>
<div class="tx">“My reason is of no interest to you.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, but of course it is! We are not your enemies, Mr. Rearden. We want to be fair to you. You mustn’t be afraid of the fact that you are a big industrialist. We won’t hold it against you. We actually want to be  as fair to you as to the lowest day laborer. We would like to know your reason.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Print my refusal in the newspapers, and any reader will tell you my reason. It appeared in all the newspapers a little over a year ago.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, no, no, no! Why talk of newspapers? Can’t we settle this as a friendly, private matter?”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s up to you.”</div>
<div class="tx">“We don’t want this in the newspapers.”</div>
<div class="tx">“No?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. We wouldn’t want to hurt you.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden glanced at him and asked, “Why does the State Science Institute need ten thousand tons of metal? What is Project X?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, that? It’s a very important project of scientific research, an undertaking of great social value that may prove of inestimable public benefit, but, unfortunately, the regulations of top policy do not permit me to tell you its nature in fuller detail.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You know,” said Rearden, “I could tell you—as my reason—that I do not wish to sell my Metal to those whose purpose is kept secret from me. I created that Metal. It is my moral responsibility to know for what purpose I permit it to be used.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, but you don’t have to worry about that, Mr. Rearden! We relieve you of the responsibility.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Suppose I don’t wish to be relieved of it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“But . . . but that is an old-fashioned and . . . and purely theoretical attitude.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I said I could name it as my reason. But I won‘t—because, in this case, I have another, inclusive reason. I would not sell any Rearden Metal to the State Science Institute for any purpose whatever, good or bad, secret or open.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Listen,” said Rearden slowly, “there might be some sort of justification for the savage societies in which a man had to expect that enemies could murder him at any moment and had to defend himself as best he could. But there can be no justification for a society in which a man is expected to manufacture the weapons for his own murderers.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t think it’s advisable to use such words, Mr. Rearden. I don’t think it’s practical to think in such terms. After all, the government cannot—in the pursuit of wide, national policies—take cognizance of your personal grudge against some one particular institution.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then don’t take cognizance of it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What do you mean?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Don’t come asking my reason.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But, Mr. Rearden, we cannot let a refusal to obey the law pass unnoticed. What do you expect us to do?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Whatever you wish.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But this is totally unprecedented. Nobody has ever refused to sell an essential commodity to the government. As a matter of fact, the law does not permit you to refuse to sell your Metal to <i>any</i> consumer, let alone the government.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, why don’t you arrest me, then?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Mr. Rearden, this is an amicable discussion. Why speak of such things as arrests?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Isn’t that your ultimate argument against me?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why bring it up?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Isn’t it implied in every sentence of this discussion?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why name it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why not?” There was no answer. “Are you trying to hide from me the fact that if it weren’t for that trump card of yours, I wouldn’t have allowed you to enter this office?”</div>
<div class="tx">“But I’m not speaking of arrests.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I am.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t understand you, Mr. Rearden.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I am not helping you to pretend that this is any sort of amicable discussion. It isn’t. Now do what you please about it.”</div>
<div class="tx">There was a strange look on the man’s face: bewilderment, as if he had no conception of the issue confronting him, and fear, as if he had always had full knowledge of it and had lived in dread of exposure.</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden felt a strange excitement; he felt as if he were about to grasp something he had never understood, as if he were on the trail of some discovery still too distant to know, except that it had the most immense importance he had ever glimpsed.</div>
<div class="tx">“Mr. Rearden,” said the man, “the government needs your Metal. You have to sell it to us, because surely you realize that the govem ment’s plans cannot be held up by the matter of your consent.”</div>
<div class="tx">“A sale,” said Rearden slowly, “requires the seller’s consent.” He got up and walked to the window. “I’ll tell you what you can do.” He pointed to the siding where ingots of Rearden Metal were being loaded onto freight cars. “There’s Rearden Metal. Drive down there with your trucks—like any other looter, but without his risk, because I won’t shoot you, as you know I can‘t—take as much of the Metal as you wish and go. Don’t try to send me payment. I won’t accept it. Don’t print out a check to me. It won’t be cashed. If you want that Metal, you have the guns to seize it. Go ahead.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Good God, Mr. Rearden, what would the public think!”</div>
<div class="tx">It was an instinctive, involuntary cry. The muscles of Rearden’s face moved briefly in a soundless laughter. Both of them had understood the implications of that cry. Rearden said evenly, in the grave, unstrained tone of finality, “You need my help to make it look like a sale—like a safe, just, moral transaction. I will not help you.”</div>
<div class="tx">The man did not argue. He rose to leave. He said only, “You will regret the stand you’ve taken, Mr. Rearden.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t think so,” said Rearden.</div>
<div class="tx">He knew that the incident was not ended. He knew also that the secrecy of Project X was not the main reason why these people feared to make the issue public. He knew that he felt an odd, joyous, light-hearted self-confidence. He knew that these were the right steps down the trail he had glimpsed.</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="046" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_046_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">Dagny lay stretched in an armchair of her living room, her eyes closed. This day had been hard, but she knew that she would see Hank Rearden tonight. The thought of it was like a lever lifting the weight of hours of senseless ugliness away from her.</div>
<div class="tx">She lay still, content to rest with the single purpose of waiting quietly for the sound of the key in the lock. He had not telephoned her, but she had heard that he was in New York today for a conference with producers of copper, and he never left the city till next morning, nor spent a night in New York that was not hers. She liked to wait for him. She needed a span of time as a bridge between her days and his nights.</div>
<div class="tx">The hours ahead, like all her nights with him, would be added, she thought, to that savings account of one’s life where moments of time are stored in the pride of having been lived. The only pride of her workday was not that it had been lived, but that it had been survived. It was wrong, she thought, it was viciously wrong that one should ever be forced to say that about any hour of one’s life. But she could not think of it now. She was thinking of him, of the struggle she had watched through the months behind them, his struggle for deliverance; she had known that she could help him win, but must help him in every way except in words.</div>
<div class="tx">She thought of the evening last winter when he came in, took a small package from his pocket and held it out to her, saying, “I want you to have it.” She opened it and stared in incredulous bewilderment at a pendant made of a single pear-shaped ruby that spurted a violent fire on the white satin of the jeweler’s box. It was a famous stone, which only a dozen men in the world could properly afford to purchase; he was not one of them.</div>
<div class="tx">“Hank . . . why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No special reason. I just wanted to see you wear it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, no, not a thing of this kind! Why waste it? I go so rarely to occasions where one has to dress. When would I ever wear it?”</div>
<div class="tx">He looked at her, his glance moving slowly from her legs to her face. “I’ll show you,” he said.</div>
<div class="tx">He led her to the bedroom, he took off her clothes, without a word, in the manner of an owner undressing a person whose consent is not required. He clasped the pendant on her shoulders. She stood naked, the stone between her breasts, like a sparkling drop of blood.</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you think a man should give jewelry to his mistress for any purpose but his own pleasure?” he asked. “This is the way I want you to wear it. Only for me. I like to look at it. It’s beautiful.”</div>
<div class="tx">She laughed; it was a soft, low, breathless sound. She could not speak or move, only nod silently in acceptance and obedience; she nodded several times, her hair swaying with the wide, circular movement of her head, then hanging still as she kept her head bowed to him.</div>
<div class="tx">She dropped down on the bed. She lay stretched lazily, her head thrown back, her arms at her sides, palms pressed to the rough texture of the bedspread, one leg bent, the long line of the other extended across the dark blue linen of the spread, the stone glowing like a wound in the semi-darkness, throwing a star of rays against her skin.</div>
<div class="tx">Her eyes were half-closed in the mocking, conscious triumph of being admired, but her mouth was half-open in helpless, begging expectation. He stood across the room, looking at her, at her flat stomach drawn in, as her breath was drawn, at the sensitive body of a sensitive consciousness. He said, his voice low, intent and oddly quiet:</div>
<div class="tx">“Dagny, if some artist painted you as you are now, men would come to look at the painting to experience a moment that nothing could give them in their own lives. They would call it great art. They would not know the nature of what they felt, but the painting would show them everything—even that you’re not some classical Venus, but the Vice-President of a railroad, because that’s part of it—even what I am, because that’s part of it, too. Dagny, they’d feel it and go away and sleep with the first barmaid in sight—and they’d never try to reach what they had felt. <i>I</i> wouldn’t want to seek it from a painting. I’d want it real. I’d take no pride in any hopeless longing. I wouldn’t hold a stillborn aspiration. I’d want to have it, to make it, to live it. Do you understand?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh yes, Hank, <i>I</i> understand!” she said. Do <i>you,</i> my darling?—do you understand it fully?—she thought, but did not say it aloud.</div>
<div class="tx">On the evening of a blizzard, she came home to find an enormous spread of tropical flowers standing in her living room against the dark glass of windows battered by snowflakes. They were stems of Hawaiian Torch Ginger, three feet tall; their large heads were cones of petals that had the sensual texture of soft leather and the color of blood. “I saw them in a florist’s window,” he told her when he came, that night. “I liked seeing them through a blizzard. But there’s nothing as wasted as an object in a public window.”</div>
<div class="tx">She began to find flowers in her apartment at unpredictable times, flowers sent without a card, but with the signature of the sender in their fantastic shapes, in the violent colors, in the extravagant cost. He brought her a gold necklace made of small hinged squares that formed a spread of solid gold to cover her neck and shoulders, like the collar of a knight’s armor—“Wear it with a black dress,” he ordered. He brought her a set of glasses that were tall, slender blocks of square-cut  crystal, made by a famous jeweler. She watched the way he held one of the glasses when she served him a drink—as if the touch of the texture under his fingers, the taste of the drink and the sight of her face were the single form of an indivisible moment of enjoyment. “I used to see things I liked,” he said, “but I never bought them. There didn’t seem to be much meaning in it. There is, now.”</div>
<div class="tx">He telephoned her at the office, one winter morning, and said, not in the tone of an invitation, but in the tone of an executive’s order, “We’re going to have dinner together tonight. I want you to dress. Do you have any sort of blue evening gown? Wear it.”</div>
<div class="tx">The dress she wore was a slender tunic of dusty blue that gave her a look of unprotected simplicity, the look of a statue in the blue shadows of a garden under the summer sun. What he brought and put over her shoulders was a cape of blue fox that swallowed her from the curve of her chin to the tips of her sandals. “Hank, that’s preposterous” —she laughed—“it’s not my kind of thing!” “No?” he asked, drawing her to a mirror.</div>
<div class="tx">The huge blanket of fur made her look like a child bundled for a snowstorm; the luxurious texture transformed the innocence of the awkward bundle into the elegance of a perversely intentional contrast: into a look of stressed sensuality. The fur was a soft brown, dimmed by an aura of blue that could not be seen, only felt like an enveloping mist, like a suggestion of color grasped not by one’s eyes but by one’s hands, as if one felt, without contact, the sensation of sinking one’s palms into the fur’s softness. The cape left nothing to be seen of her, except the brown of her hair, the blue-gray of her eyes, the shape of her mouth.</div>
<div class="tx">She turned to him, her smile startled and helpless. “I ... I didn’t know it would look like that.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I did.”</div>
<div class="tx">She sat beside him in his car as he drove through the dark streets of the city. A sparkling net of snow flashed into sight once in a while, when they went past the lights on the corners. She did not ask where they were going. She sat low in the seat, leaning back, looking up at the snowflakes. The fur cape was wrapped tightly about her; within it, her dress felt as light as a nightgown and the feel of the cape was like an embrace.</div>
<div class="tx">She looked at the angular tiers of lights rising through the snowy curtain, and—glancing at him, at the grip of his gloved hands on the wheel, at the austere, fastidious elegance of the figure in black overcoat and white muffler—she thought that he belonged in a great city, among polished sidewalks and sculptured stone.</div>
<div class="tx">The car went down into a tunnel, streaked through an echoing tube of tile under the river and rose to the coils of an elevated highway under an open black sky. The lights were below them now, spread in flat miles of bluish windows, of smokestacks, slanting cranes, red  gusts of fire, and long, dim rays silhouetting the contorted shapes of an industrial district. She thought that she had seen him once, at his mills, with smudges of soot on his forehead, dressed in acid-eaten overalls; he had worn them as naturally well as he wore his formal clothes. He belonged here, too—she thought, looking down at the flats of New Jersey—among the cranes, the fires and the grinding clatter of gears.</div>
<div class="tx">When they sped down a dark road through an empty countryside, with the strands of snow glittering across their headlights-she remembered how he had looked in the summer of their vacation, dressed in slacks, stretched on the ground of a lonely ravine, with the grass under his body and the sun on his bare arms. He belonged in the countryside, she thought—he belonged everywhere—he was a man who belonged on earth—and then she thought of the words which were more exact: he was a man to whom the earth belonged, the man at home on earth and in control. Why, then—she wondered—should he have had to carry a burden of tragedy which, in silent endurance, he had accepted so completely that he had barely known he carried it? She knew part of the answer; she felt as if the whole answer were close and she would grasp it on some approaching day. But she did not want to think of it now, because they were moving away from the burdens, because within the space of a speeding car they held the stillness of full happiness. She moved her head imperceptibly to let it touch his shoulder for a moment.</div>
<div class="tx">The car left the highway and turned toward the lighted squares of distant windows, that hung above the snow beyond a grillwork of bare branches. Then, in a soft, dim light, they sat at a table by a window facing darkness and trees. The inn stood on a knoll in the woods; it had the luxury of high cost and privacy, and an air of beautiful taste suggesting that it had not been discovered by those who sought high cost and notice. She was barely aware of the dining room; it blended away into a sense of superlative comfort, and the only ornament that caught her attention was the glitter of iced branches beyond the glass of the window.</div>
<div class="tx">She sat, looking out, the blue fur half-slipping off her naked arms and shoulders. He watched her through narrowed eyes, with the satisfaction of a man studying his own workmanship.</div>
<div class="tx">“I like giving things to you,” he said, “because you don’t need them.”</div>
<div class="tx">“No?”</div>
<div class="tx">“And it’s not that I want you to have them. I want you to have them from me.”</div>
<div class="tx">“That is the way I do need them, Hank. From you.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you understand that it’s nothing but vicious self-indulgence on my part? I’m not doing it for your pleasure, but for mine.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Hank!” The cry was involuntary; it held amusement, despair, indignation and pity. “If you’d given me those things just for my pleasure, not yours, I would have thrown them in your face.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes . . . Yes, then you would—and should.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you call it your vicious self-indulgence?”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s what they call it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, yes! That’s what they call it. What do <i>you</i> call it, Hank?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know,” he said indifferently, and went on intently. “I know only that if it’s vicious, then let me be damned for it, but that’s what I want to do more than anything else on earth.”</div>
<div class="tx">She did not answer; she sat looking straight at him with a faint smile, as if asking him to listen to the meaning of his own words.</div>
<div class="tx">“I’ve always wanted to enjoy my wealth,” he said. “I didn’t know how to do it. I didn’t even have time to know how much I wanted to. But I knew that all the steel I poured came back to me as liquid gold, and the gold was meant to harden into any shape I wished, and it was I who had to enjoy it. Only I couldn’t. I couldn’t find any purpose for it. I’ve found it, now. It’s I who’ve produced that wealth and it’s I who am going to let it buy for me every kind of pleasure I want—including the pleasure of seeing now much I’m able to pay for—including the preposterous feat of turning you into a luxury object.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But I’m a luxury object that you’ve paid for long ago,” she said; she was not smiling.</div>
<div class="tx">“How?”</div>
<div class="tx">“By means of the same values with which you paid for your mills.”</div>
<div class="tx">She did not know whether he understood it with that full, luminous finality which is a thought named in words; but she knew that what he felt in that moment was understanding. She saw the relaxation of an invisible smile in his eyes.</div>
<div class="tx">“I’ve never despised luxury,” he said, “yet I’ve always despised those who enjoyed it. I looked at what they called their pleasures and it seemed so miserably senseless to me—after what I felt at the mills. I used to watch steel being poured, tons of liquid steel running as I wanted it to, where I wanted it. And then I’d go to a banquet and I’d see people who sat trembling in awe before their own gold dishes and lace tablecloths, as if their dining room were the master and they were just objects serving it, objects created by their diamond shirt studs and necklaces, not the other way around. Then I’d run to the sight of the first slag heap I could find—and they’d say that I didn’t know how to enjoy life, because I cared for nothing but business.”</div>
<div class="tx">He looked at the dim, sculptured beauty of the room and at the people who sat at the tables. They sat in a manner of self-conscious display, as if the enormous cost of their clothes and the enormous care of their grooming should have fused into splendor, but didn’t. Their faces had a look of rancorous anxiety.</div>
<div class="tx">“Dagny, look at those people. They’re supposed to be the playboys of life, the amusement-seekers and luxury-lovers. They sit there, waiting for this place to give them meaning, not the other way around. But they’re always shown to us as the enjoyers of material pleasures -and then we’re taught that enjoyment of material pleasures is evil. Enjoyment? Are they enjoying it? Isn’t there some sort of perversion in what we’re taught, some error that’s vicious and very important?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, Hank—very vicious and very, very important.”</div>
<div class="tx">“They are the playboys, while we’re just tradesmen, you and I. Do you realize that we’re much more capable of enjoying this place than they can ever hope to be?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">He said slowly, in the tone of a quotation, “Why have we left it all to fools? It should have been ours.” She looked at him, startled. He smiled. “I remember every word you said to me at that party. I didn’t answer you then, because the only answer I had, the only thing your words meant to me, was an answer that you would hate me for, I thought; it was that I wanted you.” He looked at her. “Dagny, you didn’t intend it then, but what you were saying was that you wanted to sleep with me, wasn’t it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, Hank. Of course.”</div>
<div class="tx">He held her eyes, then looked away. They were silent for a long time. He glanced at the soft twilight around them, then at the sparkle of two wine glasses on their table. “Dagny, in my youth, when I was working in the ore mines in Minnesota, I thought that I wanted to reach an evening like this. No, that was not what I was working for, and I didn’t think of it often. But once in a while, on a winter night, when the stars were out and it was very cold, when I was tired, because I had worked two shifts, and wanted nothing on earth except to lie down and fall asleep right there, on the mine ledge—I thought that some day I would sit in a place like this, where one drink of wine would cost more than my day’s wages, and I would have earned the price of every minute of it and of every drop and of every flower on the table, and I would sit there for no purpose but my own amusement.”</div>
<div class="tx">She asked, smiling, “With your mistress?”</div>
<div class="tx">She saw the shot of pain in his eyes and wished desperately that she had not said it.</div>
<div class="tx">“With . . . a woman,” he answered. She knew the word he had not pronounced. He went on, his voice soft and steady: “When I became rich and saw what the rich did for their amusement, I thought that the place I had imagined, did not exist. I had not even imagined it too clearly. I did not know what it would be like, only what I would feel. I gave up expecting it years ago. But I feel it tonight.”</div>
<div class="tx">He raised his glass, looking at her.</div>
<div class="tx">“Hank, I ... I’d give up anything I’ve ever had in my life, except my being a ... a luxury object of your amusement.”</div>
<div class="tx">He saw her hand trembling as she held her glass. He said evenly, “I know it, dearest.”</div>
<div class="tx">She sat shocked and still: he had never used that word before. He threw his head back and smiled the most brilliantly gay smile she had ever seen on his face.</div>
<div class="tx">“Your first moment of weakness, Dagny,” he said.</div>
<div class="tx">She laughed and shook her head. He stretched his arm across the table and closed his hand over her naked shoulder, as if giving her an instant’s support. Laughing softly, and as if by accident, she let her mouth brush against his fingers; it kept her face down for the one moment when he could have seen that the brilliance of her eyes was tears.</div>
<div class="tx">When she looked up at him, her smile matched his—and the rest of the evening was their celebration—for all his years since the nights on the mine ledges—for all her years since the night of her first ball when, in desolate longing for an uncaptured vision of gaiety, she had wondered about the people who expected the lights and the flowers to make them brilliant.</div>
<div class="tx">“Isn’t there ... in what we’re taught ... some error that’s vicious and very important?”—she thought of his words, as she lay in an armchair of her living room, on a dismal evening of spring, waiting for him to come.... Just a little farther, my darling—she thought—look a little farther and you’ll be free of that error and of all the wasted pain you never should have had to carry.... But she felt that she, too, had not seen the whole of the distance, and she wondered what were the steps left for her to discover....</div>
<div class="tx">Walking through the darkness of the streets, on his way to her apartment, Rearden kept his hands in his coat pockets and his arms pressed to his sides, because he felt that he did not want to touch anything or brush against anyone. He had never experienced it before -this sense of revulsion that was not aroused by any particular object, but seemed to flood everything around him, making the city seem sodden. He could understand disgust for any one thing, and he could fight that thing with the healthy indignation of knowing that it did not belong in the world; but this was new to him—this feeling that the world was a loathsome place where he did not want to belong.</div>
<div class="tx">He had held a conference with the producers of copper, who had just been garroted by a set of directives that would put them out of existence in another year. He had had no advice to give them, no solution to offer; his ingenuity, which had made him famous as the man who would always find a way to keep production going, had not been able to discover a way to save them. But they had all known that there was no way; ingenuity was a virtue of the mind—and in the  issue confronting them, the mind had been discarded as irrelevant long ago. “It’s a deal between the boys in Washington and the importers of copper,” one of the men had said, “mainly d‘Anconia Copper.”</div>
<div class="tx">This was only a small, extraneous stab of pain, he thought, a feeling of disappointment in an expectation he had never had the right to expect; he should have known that this was just what a man like Francisco d‘Anconia would do—and he wondered angrily why he felt as if a bright, brief flame had died somewhere in a lightless world.</div>
<div class="tx">He did not know whether the impossibility of acting had given him this sense of loathing, or whether the loathing had made him lose the desire to act. It’s both, he thought; a desire presupposes the possibility of action to achieve it; action presupposes a goal which is worth achieving. If the only goal possible was to wheedle a precarious moment’s favor from men who held guns, then neither action nor desire could exist any longer.</div>
<div class="tx">Then could life?—he asked himself indifferently. Life, he thought, had been defined as motion; man’s life was purposeful motion; what was the state of a being to whom purpose and motion were denied, a being held in chains but left to breathe and to see all the magnificence of the possibilities he could have reached, left to scream “Why?” and to be shown the muzzle of a gun as sole explanation? He shrugged, walking on; he did not care even to find an answer.</div>
<div class="tx">He observed, indifferently, the devastation wrought by his own indifference. No matter how hard a struggle he had lived through in the past, he had never reached the ultimate ugliness of abandoning the will to act. In moments of suffering, he had never let pain win its one permanent victory: he had never allowed it to make him lose the desire for joy. He had never doubted the nature of the world or man’s greatness as its motive power and its core. Years ago, he had wondered with contemptuous incredulity about the fanatical sects that appeared among men in the dark corners of history, the sects who believed that man was trapped in a malevolent universe ruled by evil for the sole purpose of his torture. Tonight, he knew what their vision of the world and their feel of it had been. If what he now saw around him was the world in which he lived, then he did not want to touch any part of it, he did not want to fight it, he was an outsider with nothing at stake and no concern for remaining alive much longer.</div>
<div class="tx">Dagny and his wish to see her were the only exception left to him. The wish remained. But in a sudden shock, he realized that he felt no desire to sleep with her tonight. That desire—which had never given him a moment’s rest, which had been growing, feeding on its own satisfaction—was wiped out. It was an odd impotence, neither of his mind nor of his body. He felt, as passionately as he had ever felt it, that she was the most desirable woman on earth; but what came from it was only a desire to desire her, a wish to feel, not a feeling. The sense of numbness seemed impersonal, as if its root were neither in  him nor in her; as if it were the act of sex that now belonged to a realm which he had left.</div>
<div class="tx">“Don’t get up—stay there—it’s so obvious that you’ve been waiting for me that I want to look at it longer.”</div>
<div class="tx">He said it, from the doorway of her apartment, seeing her stretched in an armchair, seeing the eager little jolt that threw her shoulders forward as she was about to rise; he was smiling.</div>
<div class="tx">He noted—as if some part of him were watching his reactions with detached curiosity—that his smile and his sudden sense of gaiety were real. He grasped a feeling that he had always experienced, but never identified because it had always been absolute and immediate: a feeling that forbade him ever to face her in pain. It was much more than the pride of wishing to conceal his suffering: it was the feeling that suffering must not be granted recognition in her presence, that no form of claim between them should ever be motivated by pain and aimed at pity. It was not pity that he brought here or came here to find.</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you still need proof that I’m always waiting for you?” she asked, leaning obediently back in her chair; her voice was neither tender nor pleading, but bright and mocking.</div>
<div class="tx">“Dagny, why is it that most women would never admit that, but you do?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Because they’re never sure that they ought to be wanted. I am.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I do admire self-confidence.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Self-confidence was only one part of what I said, Hank.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What’s the whole?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Confidence of my value—and yours.” He glanced at her as if catching the spark of a sudden thought, and she laughed, adding, “I wouldn’t be sure of holding a man like Orren Boyle, for instance. He wouldn’t want me at all. You would.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Are you saying,” he asked slowly, “that I rose in your estimation when you found that I wanted you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Of course.”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s not the reaction of most people to being wanted.”</div>
<div class="tx">“It isn’t.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Most people feel that they rise in their own eyes, if others want them.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I feel that others live up to me, if they want me. And that is the way you feel, too, Hank, about yourself—whether you admit it or not.”</div>
<div class="tx">That’s not what I said to you then, on that first morning—he thought, looking down at her. She lay stretched out lazily, her face blank, but her eyes bright with amusement. He knew that she was thinking of it and that she knew he was. He smiled, but said nothing else.</div>
<div class="tx">As he sat half-stretched on the couch, watching her across the room, he felt at peace-as if some temporary wall had risen between him  and the things he had felt on his way here. He told her about his encounter with the man from the State Science Institute, because, even though he knew that the event held danger, an odd, glowing sense of satisfaction still remained from it in his mind.</div>
<div class="tx">He chuckled at her look of indignation. “Don’t bother being angry at them,” he said. “It’s no worse than all the rest of what they’re doing every day.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Hank, do you want me to speak to Dr. Stadler about it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Certainly not!”</div>
<div class="tx">“He ought to stop it. He could at least do that much.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’d rather go to jail. Dr. Stadler? You’re not having anything to do with him, are you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I saw him a few days ago.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“In regard to the motor.”</div>
<div class="tx">“The motor ... ?” He said it slowly, in a strange way, as if the thought of the motor had suddenly brought back to him a realm he had forgotten. “Dagny ... the man who invented that motor ... he did exist, didn’t he?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why . . . of course. What do you mean?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I mean only that ... that it’s a pleasant thought, isn’t it? Even if he’s dead now, he was alive once . . . so alive that he designed that motor....”</div>
<div class="tx">“What’s the matter, Hank?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Nothing. Tell me about the motor.”</div>
<div class="tx">She told him about her meeting with Dr. Stadler. She got up and paced the room, while speaking; she could not lie still, she always felt a surge of hope and of eagerness for action when she dealt with the subject of the motor.</div>
<div class="tx">The first thing he noticed were the lights of the city beyond the window: he felt as if they were being turned on, one by one, forming the great skyline he loved; he felt it, even though he knew that the lights had been there all the time. Then he understood that the thing which was returning was within him: the shape coming back drop by drop was his love for the city. Then he knew that it had come back because he was looking at the city past the taut, slender figure of a woman whose head was lifted eagerly as at a sight of distance, whose steps were a restless substitute for flight. He was looking at her as at a stranger, he was barely aware that she was a woman, but the sight was flowing into a feeling the words for which were: <i>This</i> is the world and the core of it, this is what made the city—they go together, the angular shapes of the buildings and the angular lines of a face stripped of everything but purpose—the rising steps of steel and the steps of a being intent upon his goal—this is what they had been, all the men who had lived to invent the lights, the steel, the furnaces, the motors-they were the world, <i>they,</i> not the men who crouched in dark corners, half-begging, half-threatening, boastfully displaying their open sores as  their only claim on life and virtue—so long as he knew that there existed one man with the bright courage of a new thought, could he give up the world to those others?—so long as he could find a single sight to give him a life-restoring shot of admiration, could he believe that the world belonged to the sores, the moans and the guns?—the men who invented motors did exist, he would never doubt their reality, it was his vision of them that had made the contrast unbearable, so that even the loathing was the tribute of his loyalty to them and to that world which was theirs and his.</div>
<div class="tx">“Darling ...” he said, “darling . . .” like a man awakening suddenly, when he noticed that she had stopped speaking.</div>
<div class="tx">“What’s the matter, Hank?” she asked softly.</div>
<div class="tx">“Nothing . . . Except that you shouldn’t have called Stadler.” His face was bright with confidence, his voice sounded amused, protective and gentle; she could discover nothing else, he looked as he had always looked, it was only the note of gentleness that seemed strange and new.</div>
<div class="tx">“I kept feeling that I shouldn’t have,” she said, “but I didn’t know why.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’ll tell you why.” He leaned forward. “What he wanted from you was a recognition that he was still the Dr. Robert Stadler he should have been, but wasn’t and knew he wasn’t. He wanted you to grant him your respect, in spite of and in contradiction to his actions. He wanted you to juggle reality for him, so that his greatness would remain, but the State Science Institute would be wiped out, as if it had never existed—and you’re the only one who could do it for him.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why I?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Because you’re the victim.”</div>
<div class="tx">She looked at him, startled. He spoke intently; he felt a sudden, violent clarity of perception, as if a surge of energy were rushing into the activity of sight, fusing the half-seen and half-grasped into a single shape and direction.</div>
<div class="tx">“Dagny, they’re doing something that we’ve never understood. They know something which we don‘t, but should discover. I can’t see it fully yet, but I’m beginning to see parts of it. That looter from the State Science Institute was scared when I refused to help him pretend that he was just an honest buyer of my Metal. He was scared way deep. Of what? I don’t know—public opinion was just his name for it, but it’s not the full name. Why should he have been scared? He has the guns, the jails, the laws—he could have seized the whole of my mills, if he wished, and nobody would have risen to defend me, and he knew it—so why should he have cared what I thought? But he did. It was I who had to tell him that he wasn’t a looter, but my customer and friend. That’s what he needed from me. And that’s what Dr. Stadler needed from you—it was you who had to act as if he were a great man who had never tried to destroy your rail and my Metal. I don’t know what it is that they think they accomplish—but  they want us to pretend that we see the world as they pretend they see it. They need some sort of sanction from us. I don’t know the nature of that sanction—but, Dagny, I know that if we value our lives, we must not give it to them. If they put you on a torture rack, don’t give it to them. Let them destroy your railroad and my mills, but don’t give it to them. Because I know this much: I know that that’s our only chance.”</div>
<div class="tx">She had remained standing still before him, looking attentively at the faint outline of some shape she, too, had tried to grasp.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes ...” she said, “yes, I know what you’ve seen in them.... I’ve felt it, too—but it’s only like something brushing past that’s gone before I know I’ve seen it, like a touch of cold air, and what’s left is always the feeling that I should have stopped it.... I know that you’re right. I can’t understand their game, but this much is right: We must not see the world as they want us to see it. It’s some sort of fraud, very ancient and very vast—and the key to break it is: to check every premise they teach us, to question every precept, to—”</div>
<div class="tx">She whirled to him at a sudden thought, but she cut the motion and the words in the same instant: the next words- would have been the ones she did not want to say to him. She stood looking at him with a slow, bright smile of curiosity.</div>
<div class="tx">Somewhere within him, he knew the thought she would not name, but he knew it only in that prenatal shape which has to find its words in the future. He did not pause to grasp it now—because in the flooding brightness of what he felt, another thought, which was its predecessor, had become clear to him and had been holding him for many minutes past. He rose, approached her and took her in his arms.</div>
<div class="tx">He held the length of her body pressed to his, as if their bodies were two currents rising upward together, each to a single point, each carrying the whole of their consciousness to the meeting of their lips.</div>
<div class="tx">What she felt in that moment contained, as one nameless part of it, the knowledge of the beauty in the posture of his body as he held her, as they stood in the middle of a room high above the lights of the city.</div>
<div class="tx">What he knew, what he had discovered tonight, was that his recaptured love of existence had not been given back to him by the return of his desire for her—but that the desire had returned after he had regained his world, the love, the value and the sense of his world—and that the desire was not an answer to her body, but a celebration of himself and of his will to live.</div>
<div class="tx">He did not know it, he did not think of it, he was past the need of words, but in the moment when he felt the response of her body to his, he felt also the unadmitted knowledge that that which he had called her depravity was her highest virtue—this capacity of hers to feel the joy of being, as he felt it.</div>
