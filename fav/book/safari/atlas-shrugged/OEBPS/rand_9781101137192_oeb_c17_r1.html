<div class="ct">CHAPTER VII</div>
<div class="cst">THE MORATORIUM ON BRAINS</div>
<div class="tx1">“Where have you been all this time?” Eddie Willers asked the worker in the underground cafeteria, and added, with a smile that was an appeal, an apology and a confession of despair, “Oh, I know it’s I who’ve stayed away from here for weeks.” The smile looked like the effort of a crippled child groping for a gesture that he could not perform any longer. “I did come here once, about two weeks ago, but you weren’t here that night. I was afraid you’d gone ... so many people are vanishing without notice. I hear there’s hundreds of them roving around the country. The police have been arresting them for leaving their jobs—they’re called deserters—but there’s too many of them and no food to feed them in jail, so nobody gives a damn any more, one way or another. I hear the deserters are just wandering about, doing odd jobs or worse—who’s got any odd jobs to offer these days? ... It’s our best men that we’re losing, the kind who’ve been with the company for twenty years or more. Why did they have to chain them to their jobs? Those men never intended to quit—but now they’re quitting at the slightest disagreement, just dropping their tools and walking off, any hour of the day or night, leaving us in all sorts of jams—the men who used to leap out of bed and come running if the railroad needed them.... You should see the kind of human driftwood we’re getting to fill the vacancies. Some of them mean well, but they’re scared of their own shadows. Others are the kind of scum I didn’t think existed—they get the jobs and they know that we can’t throw them out once they’re in, so they make it clear that they don’t intend to work for their pay and never did intend. They’re the kind of men who <i>like</i> it—who like the way things are now. Can you imagine that there are human beings who like it? Well, there are.... You know, I don’t think that I really believe it—all that’s happening to us these days. It’s happening all right, but I don’t believe it. I keep thinking that insanity is a state where a person can’t tell what’s real. Well, what’s real now is insane—and if I accepted it as real, I’d have to lose my mind, wouldn’t I? ... I go on working and I keep telling myself that this is Taggart Transcontinental. I keep waiting for her to come back—for the door to open at any moment and--oh God, I’m  not supposed to say that! ... What? You knew it? You knew that she’s gone? ... They’re keeping it secret. But I guess everybody knows it, only nobody is supposed to say it. They’re telling people that she’s away on a leave of absence. She’s still listed as our Vice-President in Charge of Operation. I think Jim and I are the only ones who know that she has resigned for good. Jim is scared to death that his friends in Washington will take it out on him, if it becomes known that she’s quit. It’s supposed to be disastrous for public morale, if any prominent person quits, and Jim doesn’t want them to know that he’s got a deserter right in his own family.... But that’s not all. Jim is scared that the stockholders, the employees and whoever we do business with, will lose the last of their confidence in Taggart Transcontinental if they learn that she’s gone. Confidence! You’d think that it wouldn’t matter now, since there’s nothing any of them can do about it. And yet, Jim knows that we have to preserve some semblance of the greatness that Taggart Transcontinental once stood for. And he knows that the last of it went with her.... No, they don’t know where she is.... Yes, I do, but I won’t tell them. I’m the only one who knows.... Oh yes, they’ve been trying to find out. They’ve tried to pump me in every way they could think of, but it’s no use. I won’t tell anyone.... You should see the trained seal that we now have in her place—our new Operating Vice-President. Oh sure, we have one—that is, we have and we haven’t. It’s like everything they do today—it is and it ain‘t, at the same time. His name is Clifton Locey—he’s from Jim’s personal staff—a bright, progressive young man of forty-seven and a friend of Jim’s. He’s only supposed to be pinch-hitting for her, but he sits in her office and we all know that that’s the new Operating Vice-President. He gives the orders—that is, he sees to it that he’s never caught actually giving an order. He works very hard at making sure that no decision can ever be pinned down on him, so that he won’t be blamed for anything. You see, his purpose is not to operate a railroad, but to hold a job. He doesn’t want to run trains—he wants to please Jim. He doesn’t give a damn whether there’s a single train moving or not, so long as he can make a good impression on Jim and on the boys in Washington. So far, Mr. Clifton Locey has managed to frame up two men: a young third assistant, for not relaying an order which Mr. Locey had never given—and the freight manager, for issuing an order which Mr. Locey did give, only the freight manager couldn’t prove it. Both men were fired, officially, by ruling of the Unification Board.... When things go well—which is never longer than half an hour—Mr. Locey makes it a point to remind us that ’.these are not the days of Miss Taggart.‘. At the first sign of trouble, he calls me into his office and asks me—casually, in the midst of the most irrelevant drivel—what Miss Taggart used to do in such an emergency. I tell him, whenever I can. I tell myself that it’s Taggart Transcontinental, and ... and there’s thousands of lives on dozens of  trains that hang on our decisions. Between emergencies, Mr. Locey goes out of his way to be rude to me—that’s so I wouldn’t think that he needs me. He’s made it a point to change everything she used to do, in every respect that doesn’t matter, but he’s damn cautious not to change anything that matters. The only trouble is that he can’t always tell which is which.... On his first day in her office, he told me that it wasn’t a good idea to have a picture of Nat Taggart on the wall—’.Nat Taggart,‘. he said, ’.belongs to a dark past, to the age of selfish greed, he is not exactly a symbol of our modern, progressive policies, so it could make a bad impression, people could identify me with him.‘. ’.No, they couldn‘t,’ I said—but I took the picture off his wall.... What? ... No, she doesn’t know any of it. I haven’t communicated with her. Not once. She told me not to.... Last week, I almost quit. It was over Chick’s Special. Mr. Chick Morrison of Washington, whoever the hell he is, has gone on a speaking tour of the whole country—to speak about the directive and build up the people’s morale, as things are getting to be pretty wild everywhere. He demanded a special train, for himself and party—a sleeper, a parlor car and a diner with barroom and lounge. The Unification Board gave him permission to travel at a hundred miles an hour—by reason, the ruling said, of this being a non-profit journey. Well, so it is. It’s just a journey to talk people into continuing to break their backs at making profits in order to support men who are superior by reason of not making any. Well, our trouble came when Mr. Chick Morrison demanded a Diesel engine for his train. We had none to give him. Every Diesel we own is out on the road, pulling the Comet and the transcontinental freights, and there wasn’t a spare one anywhere on the system, except—well, that was an exception I wasn’t going to mention to Mr. Clifton Locey. Mr. Locey raised the roof, screaming that come hell or high water we couldn’t refuse a demand of Mr. Chick Morrison. I don’t know what damn fool finally told him about the extra Diesel that was kept at Winston, Colorado, at the mouth of the tunnel. You know the way our Diesels break down nowadays, they’re all breathing their last—so you can understand why that extra Diesel had to be kept at the tunnel. I explained it to Mr. Locey, I threatened him, I pleaded, I told him that she had made it our strictest rule that Winston Station was never to be left without an extra Diesel. He told me to remember that he was not Miss Taggart—as if I could ever forget it!—and that the rule was nonsense, because nothing had happened all these years, so Winston could do without a Diesel for a couple of months, and he wasn’t going to worry about some theoretical disaster in the future when we were up against the very real, practical, immediate disaster of getting Mr. Chick Morrison angry at us. Well, Chick’s Special got the Diesel. The superintendent of the Colorado Division quit. Mr. Locey gave that job to a friend of his own. I wanted to quit. I had never wanted to so badly. But I didn’t.... No, I haven’t heard from her. I haven’t  heard a word since she left. Why do you keep questioning me about her? Forget it. She won’t be back.... I don’t know what it is that I’m hoping for. Nothing, I guess. I just go day by day, and I try not to look ahead. At first, I hoped that somebody would save us. I thought maybe it would be Hank Rearden. But he gave in. I don’t know what they did to him to make him sign, but I know that it must have been something terrible. Everybody thinks so. Everybody’s whispering about it, wondering what sort of pressure was used on him.... No, nobody knows. He’s made no public statements and he’s refused to see anyone.... But, listen, I’ll tell you something else that everybody’s whispering about. Lean closer, will you?—I don’t want to speak too loudly. They say that Orren Boyle seems to have known about that directive long ago, weeks or months in advance, because he had started, quietly and secretly, to reconstruct his furnaces for the production of Rearden Metal, in one of his lesser steel plants, an obscure little place way out on the coast of Maine. He was ready to start pouring the Metal the moment Rearden’s extortion paper—I mean, Gift Certincate—was signed. But—listen—the night before they were to start, Boyle’s men were heating the furnaces in that place on the coast, when they heard a voice, they didn’t know whether it came from a plane or a radio or some sort of loud-speaker, but it was a man’s voice and it said that he would give them ten minutes to get out of the place. They got out. They started going and they kept on going—because the man’s voice had said that he was Ragnar Danneskjöld. In the next half-hour, Boyle’s mills were razed to the ground. Razed, wiped out, not a brick of them left standing. They say it was done by long-range naval guns, from somewhere way out on the Atlantic. Nobody saw Danneskjöld’s ship.... That’s what people are whispering. The newspapers haven’t printed a word about it. The boys in Washington say that it’s only a rumor spread by panic-mongers .... I don’t know whether the story is true. I think it is. I <i>hope</i> it is.... You know, when I was fifteen years old, I used to wonder how any man could become a criminal, I couldn’t understand what would make it possible. Now—now I’m glad that Ragnar Danneskjöld has blown up those mills. May God bless him and never let them find him, whatever and wherever he is! ... Yes, that’s what I’ve come to feel. Well, how much do they think people can take? ... It’s not so bad for me in the daytime, because I can keep busy and not think, but it gets me at night. I can’t sleep any more, I lie awake for hours.... Yes!—if you want to know it—yes, it’s because I’m worried about her! I’m scared to death for her. Woodstock is just a miserable little hole of a place, miles away from everything, and the Taggart lodge is twenty miles farther, twenty miles of a twisting trail in a godforsaken forest. How do I know what might happen to her there, alone, and with the kind of gangs that are roving all through the country these nights—just through such desolate parts of the country as the Berkshires? ... I know I shouldn’t  think about it. I know that she can take care of herself. Only I wish she’d drop me a line. I wish I could go there. But she told me not to. I told her I’d wait.... You know, I’m glad you’re here tonight. It helps me—talking to you and ... just seeing you here. You won’t vanish, like all the others, will you? ... What? Next week? ... Oh, on your vacation. For how long? ... How do you rate a whole month’s vacation? ... I wish I could do that, too—take a month off at my own expense. But they wouldn’t let me.... Really? I envy you.... I wouldn’t have envied you a few years ago. But now—now I’d like to get away. Now I envy you—if you’ve been able to take a month off every summer for twelve years.”</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="062" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_062_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">It was a dark road, but it led in a new direction. Rearden walked from his mills, not toward his house, but toward the city of Philadelphia. It was a great distance to walk, but he had wanted to do it tonight, as he had done it every evening of the past week. He felt at peace in the empty darkness of the countryside, with nothing but the black shapes of trees around him, with no motion but that of his own body and of branches stirring in the wind, with no lights but the slow sparks of the fireflies flickering through the hedges. The two hours between mills and city were his span of rest.</div>
<div class="tx">He had moved out of his home to an apartment in Philadelphia. He had given no explanation to his mother and Philip, he had said nothing except that they could remain in the house if they wished and that Miss Ives would take care of their bills. He had asked them to tell Lillian, when she returned, that she was not to attempt to see him. They had stared at him in terrified silence.</div>
<div class="tx">He had handed to his attorney a signed blank check and said, “Get me a divorce. On any grounds and at any cost. I don’t care what means you use, how many of their judges you purchase or whether you find it necessary to stage a frame-up of my wife. Do whatever you wish. But there is to be no alimony and no property settlement.” The attorney had looked at him with the hint of a wise, sad smile, as if this were an event he had expected to happen long ago. He had answered, “Okay, Hank. It can be done. But it will take some time.” “Make it as fast as you can.”</div>
<div class="tx">No one had questioned him about his signature on the Gift Certificate. But he had noticed that the men at the mills looked at him with a kind of searching curiosity, almost as if they expected to find the scars of some physical torture on his body.</div>
<div class="tx">He felt nothing—nothing but the sense of an even, restful twilight, like a spread of slag over a molten metal, when it crusts and swallows the last brilliant spurt of the white glow within. He felt nothing at the thought of the looters who were now going to manufacture Rearden Metal. His desire to hold his right to it and proudly to be the only one to  sell it, had been his form of respect for his fellow men, his belief that to trade with them was an act of honor. The belief, the respect and the desire were gone. He did not care what men made, what they sold, where they bought his Metal or whether any of them would know that it had been his. The human shapes moving past him in the streets of the city were physical objects without any meaning. The countryside -with the darkness washing away all traces of human activity, leaving only an untouched earth which he had once been able to handle—was real.</div>
<div class="tx">He carried a gun in his pocket, as advised by the policemen of the radio car that patrolled the roads; they had warned him that no road was safe after dark, these days. He felt, with a touch of mirthless amusement, that the gun had been needed at the mills, not in the peaceful safety of loneliness and night; what could some starving vagrant take from him, compared to what had been taken by men who claimed to be his protectors?</div>
<div class="tx">He walked with an effortless speed, feeling relaxed by a form of activity that was natural to him. This was his period of training for solitude, he thought; he had to learn to live without any awareness of people, the awareness that now paralyzed him with revulsion. He had once built his fortune, starting out with empty hands; now he had to rebuild his life, starting out with an empty spirit.</div>
<div class="tx">He would give himself a short span of time for the training, he thought, and then he would claim the one incomparable value still left to him, the one desire that had remained pure and whole: he would go to Dagny. Two commandments had grown in his mind; one was a duty, the other a passionate wish. The first was never to let her learn the reason of his surrender to the looters; the second was to say to her the words which he should have known at their first meeting and should have said on the gallery of Ellis Wyatt’s house.</div>
<div class="tx">There was nothing but the strong summer starlight to guide him, as he walked, but he could distinguish the highway and the remnant of a stone fence ahead, at the corner of a country crossroad. The fence had nothing to protect any longer, only a spread of weeds, a willow tree bending over the road and, farther in the distance, the ruin of a farmhouse with the starlight showing through its roof.</div>
<div class="tx">He walked, thinking that even this sight still retained the power to be of value: it gave him the promise of a long stretch of space undisturbed by human intrusion.</div>
<div class="tx">The man who stepped suddenly out into the road must have come from behind the willow tree, but so swiftly that it seemed as if he had sprung up from the middle of the highway. Rearden’s hand went to the gun in his pocket, but stopped: he knew—by the proud posture of the body standing in the open, by the straight line of the shoulders against the starlit sky—that the man was not a bandit. When he heard the voice, he knew that the man was not a beggar.</div>
<div class="tx">“I should like to speak to you, Mr. Rearden.”</div>
<div class="tx">The voice had the firmness, the clarity and the special courtesy peculiar to men who are accustomed to giving orders.</div>
<div class="tx">“Go ahead,” said Rearden, “provided you don’t intend to ask me for help or money.”</div>
<div class="tx">The man’s garments were rough, but efficiently trim. He wore dark trousers and a dark blue windbreaker closed tight at his throat, prolonging the lines of his long, slender figure. He wore a dark blue cap, and all that could be seen of him in the night were his hands, his face and a patch of gold-blond hair on his temple. The hands held no weapon, only a package wrapped in burlap, the size of a carton of cigarettes.</div>
<div class="tx">“No, Mr. Rearden,” he said, “I don’t intend to ask you for money, but to return it to you.”</div>
<div class="tx">“To return money?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What money?”</div>
<div class="tx">“A small refund on a very large debt.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Owed by you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, not by me. It is only a token payment, but I want you to accept it as proof that if we live long enough, you and I, every dollar of that debt will be returned to you.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What debt?”</div>
<div class="tx">“The money that was taken from you by force.”</div>
<div class="tx">He extended the package to Rearden, flipping the burlap open. Rearden saw the starlight run like fire along a mirror-smooth surface. He knew, by its weight and texture, that what he held was a bar of solid gold.</div>
<div class="tx">He looked from the bar to the man’s face, but the face seemed harder and less revealing than the surface of the metal.</div>
<div class="tx">“Who are you?” asked Rearden.</div>
<div class="tx">“The friend of the friendless.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you come here to give this to me?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you mean that you had to stalk me at night, on a lonely road, in order, not to rob me, but to hand me a bar of gold?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“When robbery is done in open daylight by sanction of the law, as it is done today, then any act of honor or restitution has to be hidden underground.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What made you think that I’d accept a gift of this kind?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It is not a gift, Mr. Rearden. It is your own money. But I have one favor to ask of you. It is a request, not a condition, because there can be no such thing as conditional property. The gold is yours, so you are free to use it as you please. But I risked my life to bring it to you tonight, so I am asking, as a favor, that you save it for the future or spend it on yourself. On nothing but your own comfort and pleasure. Do not give it away and, above all, do not put it into your business.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Because I don’t want it to be of any benefit to anybody but you. Otherwise, I will have broken an oath taken long ago—as I am breaking every rule I had set for myself by speaking to you tonight.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What do you mean?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have been collecting this money for you for a long time. But I did not intend to see you or tell you about it or give it to you until much later.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then why did you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Because I couldn’t stand it any longer.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Stand what?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I thought that I had seen everything one could see and that there was nothing I could not stand seeing. But when they took Rearden Metal away from you, it was too much, even for me. I know that you don’t need this gold at present. What you need is the justice which it represents, and the knowledge that there are men who care for justice.”</div>
<div class="tx">Struggling not to give in to an emotion which he felt rising through his bewilderment, past all his doubts, Rearden tried to study the man’s face, searching for some clue to help him understand. But the face had no expression; it had not changed once while speaking; it looked as if the man had lost the capacity to feel long ago, and what remained of him were only features that seemed implacable and dead. With a shudder of astonishment, Rearden found himself thinking that it was not the face of a man, but of an avenging angel.</div>
<div class="tx">“Why did you care?” asked Rearden. “What do I mean to you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Much more than you have reason to suspect. And I have a friend to whom you mean much more than you will ever learn. He would have given anything to stand by you today. But he can’t come to you. So I came in his place.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What friend?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I prefer not to name him.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you say that you’ve spent a long time collecting this money for .me?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have collected much more than this.” He pointed at the gold. “I am holding it in your name and I will turn it over to you when the time comes. This is only a sample, as proof that it does exist. And if you reach the day when you find yourself robbed of the last of your fortune, I want you to remember that you have a large bank account waiting for you.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What account?”</div>
<div class="tx">“If you try to think of all the money that has been taken from you by force, you will know that your account represents a considerable sum.”</div>
<div class="tx">“How did you collect it? Where did this gold come from?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It was taken from those who robbed you.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Taken by whom?”</div>
<div class="tx">“By me.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who are you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Ragnar Danneskjöld.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden looked at him for a long, still moment, then let the gold fall out of his hands.</div>
<div class="tx">Danneskjöld’s eyes did not follow it to the ground, but remained fixed on Rearden with no change of expression. “Would you rather I were a law-abiding citizen, Mr. Rearden? If so, which law should I abide by? Directive 10-289?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Ragnar Danneskjöld ...” said Rearden, as if he were seeing the whole of the past decade, as if he were looking at the enormity of a crime spread through ten years and held within two words.</div>
<div class="tx">“Look more carefully, Mr. Rearden. There are only two modes of living left to us today: to be a looter who robs disarmed victims or to be a victim who works for the benefit of his own despoilers. I did not choose to be either.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You chose to live by means of force, like the rest of them.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes—openly. Honestly, if you will. I do not rob men who are tied and gagged, I do not demand that my victims help me, I do not tell them that I am acting for their own good. I stake my life in every encounter with men, and they have a chance to match their guns and their brains against mine in fair battle. Fair? It’s I against the organized strength, the guns, the planes, the battleships of five continents. If it’s a moral judgment that you wish to pronounce, Mr. Rearden, then who is the man of higher morality: I or Wesley Mouch?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have no answer to give you,” said Rearden, his voice low.</div>
<div class="tx">“Why should you be shocked, Mr. Rearden? I am merely complying with the system which my fellow men have established. If they believe that force is the proper means to deal with one another, I am giving them what they ask for. If they believe that the purpose of my life is to serve them, let them try to enforce their creed. If they believe that my mind is their property—let them come and get it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But what sort of life have you chosen? To what purpose are you giving your mind?”</div>
<div class="tx">“To the cause of my love.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Which is what?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Justice.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Served by being a pirate?”</div>
<div class="tx">“By working for the day when I won’t have to be a pirate any longer.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Which day is that?”</div>
<div class="tx">“The day when you’ll be free to make a profit on Rearden Metal.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh God!” said Rearden, laughing, his voice desperate. “Is that your ambition?”</div>
<div class="tx">Danneskjöld’s face did not change. “It is.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you expect to live to see that day?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes. Don’t you?”</div>
<div class="tx">.“No.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then what are you looking forward to, Mr. Rearden?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Nothing.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What are you working for?”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden glanced at him. “Why do you ask that?”</div>
<div class="tx">“To make you understand why I’m not.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Don’t expect me ever to approve of a criminal.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t expect it. But there are a few things I want to help you to see.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Even if they’re true, the things you said, why did you choose to be a. bandit? Why didn’t you simply step out, like—” He stopped.</div>
<div class="tx">“Like Ellis Wyatt, Mr. Rearden? Like Andrew Stockton? Like your friend Ken Danagger?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Would you approve of that?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I—” He stopped, shocked by his own words.</div>
<div class="tx">The shock that came next was to see Danneskjöld smile: it was like seeing the first green of spring on the sculptured planes of an ice-berg. Rearden realized suddenly, for the first time, that Danneskjöld’s face was more than handsome, that it had the startling beauty of physical perfection—the hard, proud features, the scornful mouth of a Viking’s statue—yet he had not been aware of it, almost as if the dead sternness of the face had forbidden the impertinence of an appraisal. But the smile was brilliantly alive.</div>
<div class="tx">“I do approve of it, Mr. Rearden. But I’ve chosen a special mission of my own. I’m after a man whom I want to destroy. He died many centuries ago, but until the last trace of him is wiped out of men’s minds, we will not have a decent world to live in.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What man?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Robin Hood.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden looked at him blankly, not understanding.</div>
<div class="tx">“He was the man who robbed the rich and gave to the poor. Well, I’m the man who robs the poor and gives to the rich—or, to be exact, the man who robs the thieving poor and gives back to the productive rich.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What in blazes do you mean?”</div>
<div class="tx">“If you remember the stories you’ve read about me in the newspapers, before they stopped printing them, you know that I have never robbed a private ship and never taken any private property. Nor have I ever robbed a military vessel—because the purpose of a military fleet is to protect from violence the citizens who paid for it, which is  the proper function of a government. But I have seized every loot-carrier that came within range of my guns, every government relief ship, subsidy ship, loan ship, gift ship, every vessel with a cargo of goods taken by force from some men for the unpaid, unearned benefit of others. I seized the boats that sailed under the flag of the idea which I am fighting: the idea that need is a sacred idol requiring human sacrinces—that the need of some men is the knife of a guillotine hanging over others—that all of us must live with our work, our hopes, our plans, our efforts at the mercy of the moment when that knife will descend upon us—and that the extent of our ability is the extent of our danger, so that success will bring our heads down on the block, while failure will give us the right to pull the cord. This is the horror which Robin Hood immortalized as an ideal of righteousness. It is said that he fought against the looting rulers and returned the loot to those who had been robbed, but that is not the meaning of the legend which has survived. He is remembered, not as a champion of <i>property,</i> but as a champion of <i>need,</i> not as a defender of the <i>robbed,</i> but as a provider of the <i>poor.</i> He is held to be the first man who assumed a halo of virtue by practicing charity with wealth which he did not own, by giving away goods which he had not produced, by making others pay for the luxury of his pity. He is the man who became the symbol of the idea that need, not achievement, is the source of rights, that we don’t have to produce, only to want, that the earned does not belong to us, but the unearned does. He became a justification for every mediocrity who, unable to make his own living, has demanded the power to dispose of the property of his betters, by proclaiming his willingness to devote his life to his inferiors at the price of robbing his superiors. It is this foulest of creatures—the double-parasite who lives on the sores of the poor and the blood of the rich—whom men have come to regard as a moral ideal. And this has brought us to a world where the more a man produces, the closer he comes to the loss of all his rights, until, if his ability is great enough, he becomes a rightless creature delivered as prey to any claimant—while in order to be placed above rights, above principles, above morality, placed where anything is permitted to him, even plunder and murder, all a man has to do is to be in need. Do you wonder why the world is collapsing around us? That is what I am fighting, Mr. Rearden. Until men learn that of all human symbols, Robin Hood is the most immoral and the most contemptible, there will be no justice on earth and no way for mankind to survive.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden listened, feeling numb. But under the numbness, like the first thrust of a seed breaking through, he felt an emotion he could not identify except that it seemed familiar and very distant, like something experienced and renounced long ago.</div>
<div class="tx">“What I actually am, Mr. Rearden, is a policeman. It is a policeman’s duty to protect men from criminals—criminals being those who seize wealth by force. It is a policeman’s duty to retrieve stolen  property and return it to its owners. But when robbery becomes the purpose of the law, and the policeman’s duty becomes, not the protection, but the plunder of property—then it is an outlaw who has to become a policeman. I have been selling the cargoes I retrieved to some special customers of mine in this country, who pay me in gold. Also, I have been selling my cargoes to the smugglers and the black-market traders of the People’s States of Europe. Do you know the conditions of existence in those People’s States? Since production and trade—not violence—were decreed to be crimes, the best men of Europe had no choice but to become criminals. The slave-drivers of those States are kept in power by the handouts from their fellow looters in countries not yet fully drained, such as this country. I do not let the handouts reach them. I sell the goods to Europe’s law-breakers, at the highest prices I can get, and I make them pay me in gold. Gold is the objective value, the means of preserving one’s wealth and one’s future. Nobody is permitted to have gold in Europe, except the whip-wielding friends of humanity, who claim that they spend it for the welfare of their victims. That is the gold which my smuggler-customers obtain to pay me. How? By the same method I use to obtain the goods. And then I return the gold to those from whom the goods were stolen—to you, Mr. Rearden, and to other men like you.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden grasped the nature of the emotion he had forgotten. It was the emotion he had felt when, at the age of fourteen, he had looked at his first pay check—when, at the age of twenty-four, he had been made superintendent of the ore mines—when, as the owner of the mines, he had placed, in his own name, his first order for new equipment from the best concern of the time, Twentieth Century Motors—an emotion of solemn, joyous excitement, the sense of winning his place in a world he respected and earning the recognition of men he admired. For almost two decades, that emotion had been buried under a mount of wreckage, as the years had added layer upon gray layer of contempt, of indignation, of his struggle not to look around him, not to see those he dealt with, not to expect anything from men and to keep, as a private vision within the four walls of his office, the sense of that world into which he had hoped to rise. Yet there it was again, breaking through from under the wreckage, that feeling of quickened interest, of listening to the luminous voice of reason, with which one could communicate and deal and live. But it was the voice of a pirate speaking about acts of violence, offering him this substitute for his world of reason and justice. He could not accept it; he could not lose whatever remnant of his vision he still retained. He listened, wishing he could escape, yet knowing that he would not miss a word of it.</div>
<div class="tx">“I deposit the gold in a bank—in a gold-standard bank, Mr. Rearden -to the account of men who are its rightful owners. They are the men of superlative ability who made their fortunes by personal effort, in free trade, using no compulsion, no help from the government. They  are the great victims who have contributed the most and suffered the worst injustice in return. Their names are written in my book of restitution. Every load of gold which I bring back is divided among them and deposited to their accounts.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who are they?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re one of them, Mr. Rearden. I cannot compute all the money that has been extorted from you—in hidden taxes, in regulations, in wasted time, in lost effort, in energy spent to overcome artificial obstacles. I cannot compute the sum, but if you wish to see its magnitude -look around you. The extent of the misery now spreading through this once prosperous country is the extent of the injustice which you have suffered. If men refuse to pay the debt they owe you, this is the manner in which they will pay for it. But there is one part of the debt which is computed and on record. That is the part which I have made it my purpose to collect and return to you.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What is that?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Your income tax, Mr. Rearden.”</div>
<div class="tx"><i>“What?”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“Your income tax for the last twelve years.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You intend to refund <i>that?”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“In full and in gold, Mr. Rearden.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden burst out laughing; he laughed like a young boy, in simple amusement, in enjoyment of the incredible. “Good God! You’re a policeman and a collector of Internal Revenue, too?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes,” said Danneskjöld gravely.</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re not serious about this, are you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do I look as if I’m joking?”</div>
<div class="tx">“But this is preposterous!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Any more preposterous than Directive 10-289?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s not real or possible!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Is only evil real and possible?”</div>
<div class="tx">“But—”</div>
<div class="tx">“Are you thinking that death and taxes are our only certainty, Mr. Rearden? Well, there’s nothing I can do about the first, but if I lift the burden of the second, men might learn to see the connection between the two and what a longer, happier life they have the power to achieve. They might learn to hold, not death and taxes, but life and production as their two absolutes and as the base of their moral code.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden looked at him, not smiling. The tall, slim figure, with the windbreaker stressing its trained muscular agility, was that of a highwayman ; the stern marble face was that of a judge; the dry, clear voice was that of an efficient bookkeeper.</div>
<div class="tx">“The looters are not the only ones who have kept records on you, Mr. Rearden. So have I. I have, in my files, copies of all your income tax returns for the last twelve years, as well as the returns of all my other clients. I have friends in some astonishing places, who obtain the  copies I need. I divide the money among my clients in proportion to the sums extorted from them. Most of my accounts have now been paid to their owners. Yours is the largest one left to settle. On the day when you will be ready to claim it—the day when I’ll know that no penny of it will go back to support the looters—I will turn your account over to you. Until then—” He glanced down at the gold on the ground. “Pick it up, Mr. Rearden. It’s not stolen. It’s yours.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden would not move or answer or look down.</div>
<div class="tx">“Much more than that lies in the bank, in your name.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What bank?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you remember Midas Mulligan of Chicago?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, of course.”</div>
<div class="tx">“All my accounts are deposited at the Mulligan Bank.”</div>
<div class="tx">“There is no Mulligan Bank in Chicago.”</div>
<div class="tx">“It is not in Chicago.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden let a moment pass. “Where is it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I think that you will know it before long, Mr. Rearden. But I cannot tell you now.” He added, “I must tell you, however, that I am the only one responsible for this undertaking. It is my own personal mission. No one is involved in it but me and the men of my ship’s crew. Even my banker has no part in it, except for keeping the money I deposit. Many of my friends do not approve of the course I’ve chosen. But we all choose different ways to fight the same battle—and this is mine.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden smiled contemptuously. “Aren’t you one of those damn altruists who spends his time on a non-profit venture and risks his life merely to serve others?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, Mr. Rearden. I am investing my time in my own future. When we are free and have to start rebuilding from out of the ruins, I want to see the world reborn as fast as possible. If there is, then, some working capital in the right hands—in the hands of our best, our most productive men—it will save years for the rest of us and, incidentally, centuries for the history of the country. Did you ask what you meant to me? Everything I admire, everything I want to be on the day when the earth will have a place for such state of being, everything I want to deal with—even if this is the only way I can deal with you and be of use to you at present.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why?” whispered Rearden.</div>
<div class="tx">“Because my only love, the only value I care to live for, is that which has never been loved by the world, has never won recognition or friends or defenders: human ability. That is the love I am serving—and if I should lose my life, to what better purpose could I give it?”</div>
<div class="tx">The man who had lost the capacity to feel?—thought Rearden, and knew that the austerity of the marble face was the form of a disciplined capacity to feel too deeply. The even voice was continuing dispassionately:</div>
<div class="tx">“I wanted you to know this. I wanted you to know it now, when it must seem to you that you’re abandoned at the bottom of a pit among subhuman creatures who are all that’s left of mankind. I wanted you to know, in your most hopeless hour, that the day of deliverance is much closer than you think. And there was one special reason why I had to speak to you and tell you my secret ahead of the proper time. Have you heard of what happened to Orren Boyle’s steel mills on the coast of Maine?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes,” said Rearden—and was shocked to hear that the word came as a gasp out of the sudden jolt of eagerness within him. “I didn’t know whether it was true.”</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s true. I did it. Mr. Boyle is not going to manufacture Rearden Metal on the coast of Maine. He is not going to manufacture it anywhere. Neither is any other looting louse who thinks that a directive can give him a right to your brain. Whoever attempts to produce that Metal, will find his furnaces blown up, his machinery blasted, his shipments wrecked, his plant set on fire—so many things will happen to any man who tries it, that people will say there’s a curse on it, and there will soon be no worker in the country willing to enter the plant of any new producer of Rearden Metal. If men like Boyle think that force is all they need to rob their betters—let them see what happens when one of their betters chooses to resort to force. I wanted you to know, Mr. Rearden, that none of them will produce your Metal nor make a penny on it.”</div>
<div class="tx">Because he felt an exultant desire to laugh—as he had laughed at the news of Wyatt’s fire, as he had laughed at the crash of d.‘Anconia Copper—and knew that if he did, the thing he feared would hold him, would not release him this time, and he would never see his mills again—Rearden drew back and, for a moment, kept his lips closed tight to utter no sound. When the moment was over, he said quietly, his voice firm and dead, “Take that gold of yours and get away from here. I won’t accept the help of a criminal.”</div>
<div class="tx">Danneskjöld’s face showed no reaction. “I cannot force you to accept the gold, Mr. Rearden. But I will not take it back. You may leave it lying where it is, if you wish.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t want your help and I don’t intend to protect you. If I were within reach of a phone, I would call the police. I would and I will, if you ever attempt to approach me again. I’ll do it—in self-protection.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I understand exactly what you mean.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You know—because I’ve listened to you, because you’ve seen me eager to hear it—that I haven’t damned you as I should. I can’t damn you or anyone else. There are no standards left for men to live by, so I don’t care to judge anything they do today or in what manner they attempt to endure the unendurable. If this is your manner, I will let you go to hell in your own way, but I want no part of it. Neither as your inspiration nor as your accomplice. Don’t expect me ever to accept your bank account, if it does exist. Spend it on some extra armor plate for yourself—because I’m going to report this to the police and give them every clue I can to set them on your trail.”</div>
<div class="tx">Danneskjöld did not move or answer. A freight train was rolling by, somewhere in the distance and darkness; they could not see it, but they heard the pounding beat of wheels filling the silence, and it seemed close, as if a disembodied train, reduced to a long string of sound, were going past them in the night.</div>
<div class="tx">“You wanted to help me in my most hopeless hour?” said Rearden. “If I am brought to where my only defender is a pirate, then I don’t care to be defended any longer. You speak some remnant of a human language, so in the name of that, I’ll tell you that I have no hope left, but I have the knowledge that when the end comes, I will have lived by my own standards, even while I was the only one to whom they remained valid. I will have lived in the world in which I started and I will go down with the last of it. I don’t think you’ll want to understand me, but—”</div>
<div class="tx">A beam of light hit them with the violence of a physical blow. The clangor of the train had swallowed the noise of the motor and they had not heard the approach of the car that swept out of the side road, from behind the farmhouse. They were not in the car’s path, yet they heard the screech of brakes behind the two headlights, pulling an invisible shape to a stop. It was Rearden who jumped back involuntarily and had time to marvel at his companion: the swiftness of Danneskjold’s self-control was that he did not move.</div>
<div class="tx">It was a police car and it stopped beside them.</div>
<div class="tx">The driver leaned out. “Oh, it’s you, Mr. Rearden!” he said, touching his fingers to his cap. “Good evening, sir.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Hello,” said Rearden, fighting to control the unnatural abruptness of his voice.</div>
<div class="tx">There were two patrolmen in the front seat of the car and their faces had a tight look of purpose, not the look of their usual friendly intention to stop for a chat.</div>
<div class="tx">“Mr. Rearden, did you walk from the mills by way of Edgewood Road, past Blacksmith Cove?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes. Why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you happen to see a man anywhere around these parts, a stranger moving along in a hurry?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Where?”</div>
<div class="tx">“He’d be either on foot or in a battered wreck of a car that’s got a million-dollar motor.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What man?”</div>
<div class="tx">“A tall man with blond hair.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who is he?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You wouldn’t believe it if I told you, Mr. Rearden. Did you see him?”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden was not aware of his own questions, only of the astonishing fact that he was able to force sounds past some beating barrier inside his throat. He was looking straight at the policeman, but he felt as if the focus of his eyes had switched to his side vision, and what he saw most clearly was Danneskjöld’s face watching him with no expression, with no line.‘s, no muscle’s worth of feeling. He saw Danneskjöld’s arms hanging idly by his sides, the hands relaxed, with no sign of intention to reach for a weapon, leaving the tall, straight body defenseless and open—open as to a firing squad. He saw, in the light, that the face looked younger than he had thought and that the eyes were sky-blue. He felt that his one danger would be to glance directly at Danneskjöld—and he kept his eyes on the policeman, on the brass buttons of a blue uniform, but the object filling his consciousness, more forcefully than a visual perception, was Danneskjöld’s body, the naked body under the clothes, the body that would be wiped out of existence. He did not hear his own words, because he kept hearing a single sentence in his mind, without context except the feeling that it was the only thing that mattered to him in the world: “If I should lose my life, to what better purpose could I give it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you see him, Mr. Rearden?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No,” said Rearden. “I didn’t.”</div>
<div class="tx">The policeman shrugged regretfully and closed his hands about the steering wheel. “You didn’t see any man that looked suspicious?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Nor any strange car passing you on the road?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No.”</div>
<div class="tx">The policeman reached for the starter. “They got word that he was seen ashore in these parts tonight, and they’ve thrown a dragnet over five counties. We’re not supposed to mention his name, not to scare the folks, but he’s a man whose head is worth three million dollars in rewards from all over the world.”</div>
<div class="tx">He had pressed the starter and the motor was churning the air with bright cracks of sound, when the second policeman leaned forward. He had been looking at the blond hair under Danneskjöld’s cap.</div>
<div class="tx">“Who is that, Mr. Rearden?” he asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“My new bodyguard,” said Rearden.</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh . . . ! A sensible precaution, Mr. Rearden, in times like these. Good night, sir.”</div>
<div class="tx">The motor jerked forward. The red taillights of the car went shrinking down the road. Danneskjöld watched it go, then glanced pointedly at Rearden’s right hand. Rearden realized that he had stood facing the policemen with his hand clutching the gun in his pocket and that he had been prepared to use it.</div>
<div class="tx">He opened his fingers and drew his hand out hastily. Danneskjöld smiled. It was a smile of radiant amusement, the silent laughter of a clear, young spirit greeting a moment it was glad to have lived.  And although the two did not resemble each other, the smile made Rearden think of Francisco d.‘Anconia.</div>
<div class="tx">“You haven’t told a lie,” said Ragnar Danneskjöld. “Your bodyguard—that’s what I am and what I’ll deserve to be, in many more ways than you can know at present. Thanks, Mr. Rearden, and so long—we’ll meet again much sooner than I had hoped.”</div>
<div class="tx">He was gone before Rearden could answer. He vanished beyond the stone fence, as abruptly and soundlessly as he had come. When Rearden turned to look through the farm field, there was no trace of him and no sign of movement anywhere in the darkness.</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden stood on the edge of an empty road in a spread of loneliness vaster than it had seemed before. Then he saw, lying at his feet, an object wrapped in burlap, with one corner exposed and glistening in the moonlight, the color of the pirate’s hair. He bent, picked it up and walked on.</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="063" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_063_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">Kip Chalmers swore as the train lurched and spilled his cocktail over the table top. He slumped forward, his elbow in the puddle, and said:</div>
<div class="tx">“God damn these railroads! What’s the matter with their track? You’d think with all the money they’ve got they’d disgorge a little, so we wouldn’t have to bump like farmers on a hay cart!”</div>
<div class="tx">His three companions did not take the trouble to answer. It was late, and they remained in the lounge merely because an effort was needed to retire to their compartments. The lights of the lounge looked like feeble portholes in a fog of cigarette smoke dank with the odor of alcohol. It was a private car, which Chalmers had demanded and obtained for his journey; it was attached to the end of the Comet and it swung like the tail of a nervous animal as the Comet coiled through the curves of the mountains.</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m going to campaign for the nationalization of the railroads,” said Kip Chalmers, glaring defiantly at a small, gray man who looked at him without interest. “That’s going to be my platform plank. I’ve got to have a platform plank. I don’t like Jim Taggart. He looks like a soft-boiled clam. To hell with the railroads! It’s time we took them .over.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Go to bed,” said the man, “if you expect to look like anything human at the big rally tomorrow.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you think we’ll make it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’ve got to make it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I know I’ve got to. But I don’t think we’ll get there on time. This goddamn snail of a super-special is hours late.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’ve got to get there, Kip,” said the man ominously, in that stubborn monotone of the unthinking which asserts an end without concern for the means.</div>
<div class="tx">“God damn you, don’t you suppose I know it?”</div>
<div class="tx">Kip Chalmers had curly blond hair and a shapeless mouth. He came from a semi-wealthy, semi-distinguished family, but he sneered at wealth and distinction in a manner which implied that only a top-rank aristocrat could permit himself such a degree of cynical indifference. He had graduated from a college which specialized in breeding that kind of aristocracy. The college had taught him that the purpose of ideas is to fool those who are stupid enough to think. He had made his way in Washington with the grace of a cat-burglar, climbing from bureau to bureau as from ledge to ledge of a crumbling structure. He was ranked as semi-powerful, but his manner made laymen mistake him for nothing less than Wesley Mouch.</div>
<div class="tx">For reasons of his own particular strategy, Kip Chalmers had decided to enter popular politics and to run for election as Legislator from California, though he knew nothing about that state except the movie industry and the beach clubs. His campaign manager had done the preliminary work, and Chalmers was now on his way to face his future constituents for the first time at an overpublicized rally in San Francisco tomorrow night. The manager had wanted him to start a day earlier, but Chalmers had stayed in Washington to attend a cocktail party and had taken the last train possible. He had shown no concern about the rally until this evening, when he noticed that the Comet was running six hours late.</div>
<div class="tx">His three companions did not mind his mood: they liked his liquor. Lester Tuck, his campaign manager, was a small, aging man with a face that looked as if it had once been punched in and had never rebounded. He was an attorney who, some generations earlier, would have represented shoplifters and people who stage accidents on the premises of rich corporations; now he found that he could do better by representing men like Kip Chalmers.</div>
<div class="tx">Laura Bradford was Chalmers’ current mistress; he liked her because his predecessor had been Wesley Mouch. She was a movie actress who had forced her way from competent featured player to incompetent star, not by means of sleeping with studio executives, but by taking the long-distance short cut of sleeping with bureaucrats. She talked economics, instead of glamor, for press interviews, in the belligerently righteous style of a third-rate tabloid; her economics consisted of the assertion that “we’ve got to help the poor.”</div>
<div class="tx">Gilbert Keith-Worthing was Chalmers’ guest, for no reason that either of them could discover. He was a British novelist of world fame, who had been popular thirty years ago; since then, nobody bothered to read what he wrote, but everybody accepted him as a walking classic. He had been considered profound for uttering such things as: “Freedom? Do let’s stop talking about freedom. Freedom is impossible. Man can never be free of hunger, of cold, of disease, of physical accidents. He can never be free of the tyranny of nature. So why should he object to the tyranny of a political dictatorship?” When all of Europe  put into practice the ideas which he had preached, he came to live in America. Through the years, his style of writing and his body had grown flabby. At seventy, he was an obese old man with retouched hair and a manner of scornful cynicism retouched by quotations from the yogis about the futility of all human endeavor. Kip Chalmers had invited him, because it seemed to look distinguished. Gilbert Keith-Worthing had come along, because he had no particular place to go.</div>
<div class="tx">“God damn these railroad people!” said Kip Chalmers. “They’re doing it on purpose. They want to ruin my campaign. I can’t miss that rally! For Christ’s sake, Lester, do something!”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’ve tried,” said Lester Tuck. At the train’s last stop, he had tried, by long-distance telephone, to find air transportation to complete their journey; but there were no commercial flights scheduled for the next two days.</div>
<div class="tx">“If they don’t get me there on time, I’ll have their scalps and their railroad! Can’t we tell that damn conductor to hurry?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’ve told him three times.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’ll get him fired. He’s given me nothing but a lot of alibis about all their messy technical troubles. I expect transportation, not alibis. They can’t treat me like one of their day-coach passengers. I expect them to get me where I want to go when I want it. Don’t they know that I’m on this train?”</div>
<div class="tx">“They know it by now,” said Laura Bradford. “Shut up, Kip. You bore me.”</div>
<div class="tx">Chalmers refilled his glass. The car was rocking and the glassware tinkled faintly on the shelves of the bar. The patches of starlit sky in the windows kept swaying jerkily, and it seemed as if the stars were tinkling against one another. They could see nothing beyond the glass bay of the observation window at the end of the car, except the small halos of red and green lanterns marking the rear of the train, and a brief stretch of rail running away from them into the darkness. A wall of rock was racing the train, and the stars dipped occasionally into a sudden break that outlined, high above them, the peaks of the mountains of Colorado.</div>
<div class="tx">“Mountains ...” said Gilbert Keith-Worthing, with satisfaction. “It is a spectacle of this kind that makes one feel the insignificance of man. What is this presumptuous little bit of rail, which crude materialists are so proud of building—compared to that eternal grandeur? No more than the basting thread of a seamstress on the hem of the garment of nature. If a single one of those granite giants chose to crumble, it would annihilate this train.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why should it choose to crumble?” asked Laura Bradford, without any particular interest.</div>
<div class="tx">“I think this damn train is going slower,” said Kip Chalmers. “Those bastards are slowing down, in spite of what I told them!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well . . . it’s the mountains, you know . . .” said Lester Tuck. </div>
<div class="tx">“Mountains be damned! Lester, what day is this? With all those damn changes of time, I can’t tell which—”</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s May twenty-seventh,” sighed Lester Tuck.</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s May twenty-eighth,” said Gilbert Keith-Worthing, glancing at his watch. “It is now twelve minutes past midnight.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Jesus!” cried Chalmers. “Then the rally is <i>today?”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“Yep,” said Lester Tuck.</div>
<div class="tx">“We won’t make it! We—”</div>
<div class="tx">The train gave a sharper lurch, knocking the glass out of his hand. The thin sound of its crash against the floor mixed with the screech of the wheel-flanges tearing against the rail of a sharp curve.</div>
<div class="tx">“I say,” asked Gilbert Keith-Worthing nervously, “are your railroads .safe?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Hell, yes!” said Kip Chalmers. “We’ve got so many rules, regulations and controls that those bastards wouldn’t dare not to be safe! ... Lester, how far are we now? What’s the next stop?”</div>
<div class="tx">“There won’t be any stop till Salt Lake City.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I mean, what’s the next station?”</div>
<div class="tx">Lester Tuck produced a soiled map, which he had been consulting every few minutes since nightfall. “Winston,” he said. “Winston, Colorado.”</div>
<div class="tx">Kip Chalmers reached for another glass.</div>
<div class="tx">“Tinky Holloway said that Wesley said that if you don’t win this election, you’re through,” said Laura Bradford. She sat sprawled in her chair, looking past Chalmers, studying her own face in a mirror on the wall of the lounge; she was bored and it amused her to needle his impotent anger.</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, he did, did he?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Uh-huh. Wesley doesn’t want what.‘s-his-name—whoever’s running against you—to get into the Legislature. If you don’t win, Wesley will be sore as hell. Tinky said—”</div>
<div class="tx">“Damn that bastard! He’d better watch his own neck!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, I don’t know. Wesley likes him very much.” She added, “Tinky Holloway wouldn’t allow some miserable train to make him miss an important meeting. They wouldn’t dare to hold <i>him</i> up.”</div>
<div class="tx">Kip Chalmers sat staring at his glass. “I’m going to have the government seize all the railroads,” he said, his voice low.</div>
<div class="tx">“Really,” said Gilbert Keith-Worthing, “I don’t see why you haven’t done it long ago. This is the only country on earth backward enough to permit private ownership of railroads.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, we’re catching up with you,” said Kip Chalmers.</div>
<div class="tx">“Your country is so incredibly naive. It’s such an anachronism. All that talk about liberty and human rights—I haven’t heard it since the days of my great-grandfather. It’s nothing but a verbal luxury of the rich. After all, it doesn’t make any difference to the poor whether their livelihood is at the mercy of an industrialist or of a bureaucrat.”</div>
<div class="tx">“The day of the industrialists is over. This is the day of—”</div>
<div class="tx">The jolt felt as if the air within the car smashed them forward while the floor stopped under their feet. Kip Chalmers was flung down to the carpet, Gilbert Keith-Worthing was thrown across the table top, the lights were blasted out. Glasses crashed off the shelves, the steel of the walls screamed as if about to rip open, while a long, distant thud went like a convulsion through the wheels of the train.</div>
<div class="tx">When he raised his head, Chalmers saw that the car stood intact and still; he heard the moans of his companions and the first shriek of Laura Bradford’s hysterics. He crawled along the floor to the doorway, wrenched it open, and tumbled down the steps. Far ahead, on the side of a curve, he saw moving flashlights and a red glow at a spot where the engine had no place to be. He stumbled through the darkness, bumping into half-clothed figures that waved the futile little flares of matches. Somewhere along the line, he saw a man with a flashlight and seized his arm. It was the conductor.</div>
<div class="tx">“What happened?” gasped Chalmers.</div>
<div class="tx">“Split rail,” the conductor answered impassively. “The engine went off the track.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Off ... ?”</div>
<div class="tx">“On its side.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Anybody . . . killed?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. The engineer’s all right. The fireman is hurt.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Split rail? What do you mean, split rail?”</div>
<div class="tx">The conductor’s face had an odd look: it was grim, accusing and closed. “Rail wears out, Mr. Chalmers,” he answered with a strange kind of emphasis. “Particularly on curves.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Didn’t you know that it was worn out?”</div>
<div class="tx"><i>“We</i> knew.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, why didn’t you have it replaced?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It was going to be replaced. But Mr. Locey cancelled that.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who is Mr. Locey?”</div>
<div class="tx">“The man who is not our Operating Vice-President.”</div>
<div class="tx">Chalmers wondered why the conductor seemed to look at him as if something about the catastrophe were his fault. “Well . . . well, aren’t you going to put the engine back on the track?”</div>
<div class="tx">“That engine’s never going to be put back on any track, from the looks of it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But . . . but it’s got to move us!”</div>
<div class="tx">“It can’t.”</div>
<div class="tx">Beyond the few moving flares and the dulled sounds of screams, Chalmers sensed suddenly, not wanting to look at it, the black immensity of the mountains, the silence of hundreds of uninhabited miles, and the precarious strip of a ledge hanging between a wall of rock and an abyss. He gripped the conductor’s arm tighter.</div>
<div class="tx">“But ... but what are we going to do?”</div>
<div class="tx">“The engineer’s gone to call Winston.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Call? How?”</div>
<div class="tx">“There’s a phone couple of miles down the track.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Will they get us out of here?”</div>
<div class="tx">“They will.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But ...” Then his mind made a connection with the past and the future, and his voice rose to a scream for the first time: “How long will we have to wait?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know,” said the conductor. He threw Chalmers’ hand off his arm, and walked away.</div>
<div class="tx">The night operator of Winston Station listened to the phone message, dropped the receiver and raced up the stairs to shake the station agent out of bed. The station agent was a husky, surly drifter who had been assigned to the job ten days ago, by order of the new division superintendent. He stumbled dazedly to his feet, but he was knocked awake when the operator’s words reached his brain.</div>
<div class="tx">“What?” he gasped. “Jesus! The Comet? . . . Well, don’t stand there shaking! Call Silver Springs!”</div>
<div class="tx">The night dispatcher of the Division Headquarters at Silver Springs listened to the message, then telephoned Dave Mitchum, the new superintendent of the Colorado Division.</div>
<div class="tx">“The Comet?” gasped Mitchum, his hand pressing the telephone receiver to his ear, his feet hitting the floor and throwing him upright, out of bed. “The engine done for? The <i>Diesel?”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, sir.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh God! Oh, God Almighty! What are we going to do?” Then, remembering his position, he added, “Well, send out the wrecking train.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Call the operator at Sherwood to hold all traffic.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What have you got on the sheet?”</div>
<div class="tx">“The Army Freight Special, westbound. But it’s not due for about four hours. It’s running late.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’ll be right down.... Wait, listen, get Bill, Sandy and Clarence down by the time I get there. There’s going to be hell to pay!”</div>
<div class="tx">Dave Mitchum had always complained about injustice, because, he said, he had always had bad luck. He explained it by speaking darkly about the conspiracy of the big fellows, who would never give him a chance, though he did not explain just whom he meant by “the big fellows.” Seniority of service was his favorite topic of complaint and sole standard of value; he had been in the railroad business longer than many men who had advanced beyond him; this, he said, was proof of the social system’s injustice—though he never explained just what he meant by “the social system.” He had worked for many railroads, but had not stayed long with any one of them. His employers had had no specific misdeeds to charge against him, but had simply eased him out, because he said, “Nobody told me to!” too often. He did not know that he owed his present job to a deal between James Taggart and Wesley Mouch: when Taggart traded to Mouch the secret of his sister’s private life, in exchange for a raise in rates, Mouch made him throw in an extra favor, by their customary rules of bargaining, which consisted of squeezing all one could out of any given trade. The extra was a job for Dave Mitchum, who was the brother-in-law of Claude Slagenhop, who was the president of the Friends of Global Progress, who were regarded by Mouch as a valuable influence on public opinion. James Taggart pushed the responsibility of finding a job for Mitchum onto Clifton Locey. Locey pushed Mitchum into the first job that came up—superintendent of the Colorado Division—when the man holding it quit without notice. The man quit when the extra Diesel engine of Winston Station was given to Chick Morrison’s Special.</div>
<div class="tx">“What are we going to do?” cried Dave Mitchum, rushing, half-dressed and groggy with sleep, into his office, where the chief dispatcher, the trainmaster and the road foreman of engines were waiting for him.</div>
<div class="tx">The three men did not answer. They were middle-aged men with years of railroad service behind them. A month ago, they would have volunteered their advice in any emergency; but they were beginning to learn that things had changed and that it was dangerous to speak.</div>
<div class="tx">“What in hell are we going to do?”</div>
<div class="tx">“One thing is certain,” said Bill Brent, the chief dispatcher. “We can’t send a train into the tunnel with a coal-burning engine.”</div>
<div class="tx">Dave Mitchum’s eyes grew sullen: he knew that this was the one thought on all their minds; he wished Brent had not named it.</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, where do we get a Diesel?” he asked angrily.</div>
<div class="tx">“We don.‘t,” said the road foreman.</div>
<div class="tx">“But we can’t keep the Comet waiting on a siding all night!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Looks like we’ll have to,” said the trainmaster. “What’s the use of talking about it, Dave? You know that there is no Diesel anywhere on the division.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But Christ Almighty, how do they expect us to move trains without engines?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Miss Taggart didn.‘t,” said the road foreman. “Mr. Locey does.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Bill,” asked Mitchum, in the tone of pleading for a favor, “isn’t there anything transcontinental that’s due tonight, with any sort of a .Diesel?”</div>
<div class="tx">“The first one to come,” said Bill Brent implacably, “will be Number 236, the fast freight from San Francisco, which is due at Winston at seven-eighteen A.M.” He added, “That’s the Diesel closest to us at this moment. I’ve checked.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What about the Army Special?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Better not think about it, Dave. That one has superiority over everything on the line, including the Comet, by order of the Army. They’re running late as it is—journal boxes caught fire twice. They’re carrying munitions for the West Coast arsenals. Better pray that nothing stops them on your division. If you think we’ll catch hell for holding the Comet, it’s nothing to what we’ll catch if we try to stop that Special.”</div>
<div class="tx">They remained silent. The windows were open to the summer night and they could hear the ringing of the telephone in the dispatcher’s office downstairs. The signal lights winked over the deserted yards that had once been a busy division point.</div>
<div class="tx">Mitchum looked toward the roundhouse, where the black silhouettes of a few steam engines stood outlined in a dim light.</div>
<div class="tx">“The tunnel—” he said and stopped.</div>
<div class="tx">“—is eight miles long,” said the trainmaster, with a harsh emphasis.</div>
<div class="tx">“I was only thinking,” snapped Mitchum.</div>
<div class="tx">“Better not think of it,” said Brent softly.</div>
<div class="tx">“I haven’t said anything!”</div>
<div class="tx">“What was that talk you had with Dick Horton before he quit?” the road foreman asked too innocently, as if the subject were irrelevant. “Wasn’t it something about the ventilation system of the tunnel being on the bum? Didn’t he say that that tunnel was hardly safe nowadays even for Diesel engines?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why do you bring that up?” snapped Mitchum. “I haven’t said anything!” Dick Horton, the division chief engineer, had quit three days after Mitchum’s arrival.</div>
<div class="tx">“I thought I’d just mention it,” the road foreman answered innocently.</div>
<div class="tx">“Look, Dave,” said Bill Brent, knowing that Mitchum would stall for another hour rather than formulate a decision, “you know that there’s only one thing to do: hold the Comet at Winston till morning, wait for Number 236, have her Diesel take the Comet through the tunnel, then let the Comet finish her run with the best coal-burner we can give her on the other side.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But how late will that make her?”</div>
<div class="tx">Brent shrugged. “Twelve hours—eighteen hours—who knows?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Eighteen hours—for the Comet? Christ, that’s never happened before!”</div>
<div class="tx">“None of what’s been happening to us has ever happened before,” said Brent, with an astonishing sound of weariness in his brisk, competent voice.</div>
<div class="tx">“But they’ll blame us for it in New York! They’ll put all the blame on us!”</div>
<div class="tx">Brent shrugged. A month ago, he would have considered such an injustice inconceivable; today, he knew better.</div>
<div class="tx">“I guess ...” said Mitchum miserably, “I guess there’s nothing else that we can do.”</div>
<div class="tx">“There isn.‘t, Dave.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh God! Why did this have to happen to us?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who is John Galt?”</div>
<div class="tx">It was half-past two when the Comet, pulled by an old switch engine, jerked to a stop on a siding of Winston Station. Kip Chalmers glanced out with incredulous anger at the few shanties on a desolate mountainside and at the ancient hovel of a station.</div>
<div class="tx">“Now what? What in hell are they stopping <i>here</i> for?” he cried, and rang for the conductor.</div>
<div class="tx">With the return of motion and safety, his terror had turned into rage. He felt almost as if he had been cheated by having been made to experience an unnecessary fear. His companions were still clinging to the tables of the lounge; they felt too shaken to sleep.</div>
<div class="tx">“How long?” the conductor said impassively, in answer to his question. “Till morning, Mr. Chalmers.”</div>
<div class="tx">Chalmers stared at him, stupefied. “We’re going to stand here till morning?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, Mr. Chalmers.”</div>
<div class="tx"><i>“Here?”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But I have a rally in San Francisco in the evening!”</div>
<div class="tx">The conductor did not answer.</div>
<div class="tx">“Why? Why do we have to stand? Why in hell? What happened?”</div>
<div class="tx">Slowly, patiently, with contemptuous politeness, the conductor gave him an exact account of the situation. But years ago, in grammar school, in high school, in college, Kip Chalmers had been taught that man does not and need not live by reason.</div>
<div class="tx">“Damn your tunnel!” he screamed. “Do you think I’m going to let you hold me up because of some miserable tunnel? Do you want to wreck vital national plans on account of a tunnel? Tell your engineer that I must be in San Francisco by evening and that he’s got to get me there! ”</div>
<div class="tx">“How?”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s <i>your</i> job, not mine!”</div>
<div class="tx">“There is no way to do it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then find a way, God damn you!”</div>
<div class="tx">The conductor did not answer.</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you think I’ll let your miserable technological problems interfere with crucial social issues? Do you know who I am? Tell that engineer to start moving, if he values his job!”</div>
<div class="tx">“The engineer has his orders.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Orders be damned! <i>I</i> give the orders these days! Tell him to start .at once!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Perhaps you’d better speak to the station agent, Mr. Chalmers. I  have no authority to answer you as I’d like to,” said the conductor, and walked out.</div>
<div class="tx">Chalmers leaped to his feet. “Say, Kip ...” said Lester Tuck uneasily, “maybe it’s true ... maybe they can’t do it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“They can if they have to!” snapped Chalmers, marching resolutely to the door.</div>
<div class="tx">Years ago, in college, he had been taught that the only effective means to impel men to action was fear.</div>
<div class="tx">In the dilapidated office of Winston Station, he confronted a sleepy man with slack, worn features, and a frightened young boy who sat at the operator’s desk. They listened, in silent stupor, to a stream of profanity such as they had never heard from any section gang.</div>
<div class="tx">“—and it’s not <i>my</i> problem how you get the train through the tunnel, that’s for <i>you</i> to figure out!” Chalmers concluded. “But if you don’t get me an engine and don’t start that train, you can kiss good-bye to your jobs, your work permits and this whole goddamn railroad!”</div>
<div class="tx">The station agent had never heard of Kip Chalmers and did not know the nature of his position. But he knew that this was the day when unknown men in undefined positions held unlimited power—the power of life or death.</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s not up to us, Mr. Chalmers,” he said pleadingly. “We don’t issue the orders out here. The order came from Silver Springs. Suppose you telephone Mr. Mitchum and—”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who’s Mr. Mitchum?”</div>
<div class="tx">“He’s the division superintendent at Silver Springs. Suppose you send him a message to—”</div>
<div class="tx">“I should bother with a division superintendent! I’ll send a message to Jim Taggart—that’s what I’m going to do!”</div>
<div class="tx">Before the station agent had time to recover, Chalmers whirled to the boy, ordering, “You—take this down and send it at once!”</div>
<div class="tx">It was a message which, a month ago, the station agent would not have accepted from any passenger; the rules forbade it; but he was not certain about any rules any longer: .<div class="atx1"><div class="tx">Mr. James Taggart, New York City. Am held up on the Comet at Winston, Colorado, by the incompetence of your men, who refuse to give me an engine. Have meeting in San Francisco in the evening of top-level national importance. If you don’t move my train at once, I’ll let you guess the consequences. Kip Chalmers.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tx">After the boy had transmitted the words onto the wires that stretched from pole to pole across a continent as guardians of the Taggart track—after Kip Chalmers had returned to his car to wait for an answer—the station agent telephoned Dave Mitchum, who was his friend, and read to him the text of the message. He heard Mitchum groan in answer.</div>
<div class="tx">“I thought I’d tell you, Dave. 1 never heard of the guy before, but maybe he’s somebody important.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know!” moaned Mitchum. “Kip Chalmers? You see his name in the newspapers all the time, right in with all the top-level boys. I don’t know what he is, but if he’s from Washington, we can’t take any chances. Oh Christ, what are we going to do?”</div>
<div class="tx">We can’t take any chances—thought the Taggart operator in New York, and transmitted the message by telephone to James Taggart’s home. It was close to six A.M. in New York, and James Taggart was awakened out of the fitful sleep of a restless night. He listened to the telephone, his face sagging. He felt the same fear as the station agent of Winston, and for the same reason.</div>
<div class="tx">He called the home of Clifton Locey. All the rage which he could not pour upon Kip Chalmers, was poured over the telephone wire upon Clifton Locey. “Do something!” screamed Taggart. “I don’t care what you do, it’s <i>your</i> job, not mine, but see to it that that train gets through! What in hell is going on? I never heard of the Comet being held up! Is that how you run your department? It’s a fine thing when important passengers have to start sending messages to <i>me!</i> At least, when my sister ran the place, I wasn’t awakened in the middle of the night over every spike that broke in Iowa—Colorado, I mean!”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m so sorry, Jim,” said Clifton Locey smoothly, in a tone that balanced apology, reassurance and the right degree of patronizing confidence. “It’s just a misunderstanding. It’s somebody’s stupid mistake. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. I was, as a matter of fact, in bed, but I’ll attend to it at once.”</div>
<div class="tx">Clifton Locey was not in bed; he had just returned from a round of night clubs, in the company of a young lady. He asked her to wait and hurried to the offices of Taggart Transcontinental. None of the night staff who saw him there could say why he chose to appear in person, but neither could they say that it had been unnecessary. He rushed in and out of several offices, was seen by many people and gave an impression of great activity. The only physical result of it was an order that went over the wires to Dave Mitchum, superintendent of the Colorado Division:</div>
<div class="tx">“Give an engine to Mr. Chalmers at once. Send the Comet through safely and without unnecessary delay. If you are unable to perform your duties, I shall hold you responsible before the Unification Board. Clifton Locey.”</div>
<div class="tx">Then, calling his girl friend to join him, Clifton Locey drove to a country roadhouse—to make certain that no one would be able to find him in the next few hours.</div>
<div class="tx">The dispatcher at Silver Springs was baffled by the order that he handed to Dave Mitchum, but Dave Mitchum understood. He knew that no railroad order would ever speak in such terms as giving an engine to a passenger; he knew that the thing was a show piece, he  guessed what sort of show was being staged, and he felt a cold sweat at the realization of who was being framed as the goat of the show.</div>
<div class="tx">“What’s the matter, Dave?” asked the trainmaster.</div>
<div class="tx">Mitchum did not answer. He seized the telephone, his hands shaking as he begged for a conection to the Taggart operator in New York. He looked like an animal in a trap.</div>
<div class="tx">He begged the New York operator to get him Mr. Clifton Locey’s home. The operator tried. There was no answer. He begged the operator to keep on trying and to try every number he could think of, where Mr. Locey might be found. The operator promised and Mitchum hung up, but knew that it was useless to wait or to speak to anyone in Mr. Locey’s department.</div>
<div class="tx">“What’s the matter, Dave?”</div>
<div class="tx">Mitchum handed him the order—and saw by the look on the trainmaster’s face that the trap was as bad as he had suspected.</div>
<div class="tx">He called the Region Headquarters of Taggart Transcontinental at Omaha, Nebraska, and begged to speak to the general manager of the region. There was a brief silence on the wire, then the voice of the Omaha operator told him that the general manager had resigned and vanished three days ago—“over a little trouble with Mr. Locey,” the voice added.</div>
<div class="tx">He asked to speak to the assistant general manager in charge of his particular district; but the assistant was out of town for the week end and could not be reached.</div>
<div class="tx">“Get me somebody else!” Mitchum screamed. “Anybody, of any district! For Christ’s sake, get me somebody who’ll tell me what to do!”</div>
<div class="tx">The man who came on the wire was the assistant general manager of the Iowa-Minnesota District.</div>
<div class="tx">“What?” he interrupted at Mitchum’s first words. “At Winston, Colorado ? Why in hell are you calling <i>me?</i> ... No, don’t tell me what happened, I don’t want to know it! ... No, I said! No! You’re not going to frame me into having to explain afterwards why I did or didn’t do anything about whatever it is. It’s not <i>my</i> problem! ... Speak to some region executive, don’t pick on me, what do I have to do with Colorado? ... Oh hell, I don’t know, get the chief engineer, speak to him!”</div>
<div class="tx">The chief engineer of the Central Region answered impatiently, “Yes? What? What is it?”—and Mitchum rushed desperately to explain. When the chief engineer heard that there was no Diesel, he snapped, “Then hold the train, of course!” When he heard about Mr. Chalmers, he said, his voice suddenly subdued, “Hm ... Kip Chalmers? Of Washington? ... Well, I don’t know. That would be a matter for Mr. Locey to decide.” When Mitchum said, “Mr. Locey ordered me to arrange it, but—” the chief engineer snapped in great relief, “Then do exactly as Mr. Locey says!” and hung up.</div>
<div class="tx">Dave Mitchum replaced the telephone receiver cautiously. He did not scream any longer. Instead, he tiptoed to a chair, almost as if he were sneaking. He sat looking at Mr. Locey’s order for a long time.</div>
<div class="tx">Then he snatched a glance about the room. The dispatcher was busy at his telephone. The trainmaster and the road foreman were there, but they pretended that they were not waiting. He wished Bill Brent, the chief dispatcher, would go home; Bill Brent stood in a corner, watching him.</div>
<div class="tx">Brent was a short, thin man with broad shoulders; he was forty, but looked younger; he had the pale face of an office worker and the hard, lean features of a cowboy. He was the best dispatcher on the system. .</div>
<div class="tx">Mitchum rose abruptly and walked upstairs to his office, clutching Locey’s order in his hand.</div>
<div class="tx">Dave Mitchum was not good at understanding problems of engineering and transportation, but he understood men like Clifton Locey. He understood the kind of game the New York executives were playing and what they were now doing to him. The order did not tell him to give Mr. Chalmers a coal-burning engine—just “an engine.” If the time came to answer questions, wouldn’t Mr. Locey gasp in shocked indignation that he had expected a division superintendent to know that only a Diesel engine could be meant in that order? The order stated that he was to send the Comet through <i>“safely</i>”—wasn’t a division superintendent expected to know what was safe?—“and without unnecessary delay.” What was an <i>unnecessary</i> delay? If the possibility of a major disaster was involved, wouldn’t a delay of a week or a month be considered necessary?</div>
<div class="tx">The New York executives did not care, thought Mitchum; they did not care whether Mr. Chalmers reached his meeting on time, or whether an unprecedented catastrophe struck their rails; they cared only about making sure that they would not be blamed for either. If he held the train, they would make him the scapegoat to appease the anger of Mr. Chalmers; if he sent the train through and it did not reach .the western portal of the tunnel, they would put the blame on his in competence ; they would claim that he had acted against their orders, in either case. What would he be able to prove? To whom? One could prove nothing to a tribunal that had no stated policy, no defined procedure, no rules of evidence, no binding principles—a tribunal, such as the Unification Board, that pronounced men guilty or innocent as it saw fit, with no standard of guilt or innocence.</div>
<div class="tx">Dave Mitchum knew nothing about the philosophy of law; but he knew that when a court is not bound by any rules, it is not bound by any facts, and then a hearing is not an issue of justice, but an issue of men, and your fate depends not on what you have or have not done, but on whom you do or do not know. He asked himself what chance he would have at such a hearing against Mr. James Taggart,  Mr. Clifton Locey, Mr. Kip Chalmers and their powerful friends.</div>
<div class="tx">Dave Mitchum had spent his life slipping around the necessity of ever making a decision; he had done it by waiting to be told and never being certain of anything. All that he now allowed into his brain was a long, indignant whine against injustice. Fate, he thought, had singled him out for an unfair amount of bad luck: he was being framed by his superiors on the only good job he had ever held. He had never been taught to understand that the manner in which he obtained this job, and the frame-up, were inextricable parts of a single whole.</div>
<div class="tx">As he looked at Locey’s order, he thought that he could hold the Comet, attach Mr. Chalmers’ car to an engine and send it into the tunnel, alone. But he shook his head before the thought was fully formed: he knew that this would force Mr. Chalmers to recognize the nature of the risk; Mr. Chalmers would refuse; he would continue to demand a safe and non-existent engine. And more: this would mean that he, Mitchum, would have to assume responsibility, admit full knowledge of the danger, stand in the open and identify the exact nature of the situation—the one act which the policy of his superiors was based on evading, the one key to their game.</div>
<div class="tx">Dave Mitchum was not the man to rebel against his background or to question the moral code of those in charge. The choice he made was not to challenge, but to follow the policy of his superiors. Bill Brent could have beaten him in any contest of technology, but here was an endeavor at which he could beat Bill Brent without effort. There had once been a society where men needed the particular talents of Bill Brent, if they wished to survive; what they needed now was the talent of Dave Mitchum.</div>
<div class="tx">Dave Mitchum sat down at his secretary’s typewriter and, by means of two fingers, carefully typed out an order to the trainmaster and another to the road foreman. The first instructed the trainmaster to summon a locomotive crew at once, for a purpose described only as “an emergency”; the second instructed the road foreman to “send the best engine available to Winston, to stand by for emergency assistance.”</div>
<div class="tx">He put carbon copies of the orders into his own pocket, then opened the door, yelled for the night dispatcher to come up and handed him the two orders for the two men downstairs. The night dispatcher was a conscientious young boy who trusted his superiors and knew that discipline was the first rule of the railroad business. He was astonished that Mitchum should wish to send written orders down one flight of stairs, but he asked no questions.</div>
<div class="tx">Mitchum waited nervously. After a while, he saw the figure of the road foreman walking across the yards toward the roundhouse. He felt relieved: the two men had not come up to confront him in person; they had understood and they would play the game as he was playing it.</div>
<div class="tx">The road foreman walked across the yards, looking down at the ground. He was thinking of his wife, his two children and the house which he had spent a lifetime to own. He knew what his superiors were doing and he wondered whether he should refuse to obey them. He had never been afraid of losing his job; with the confidence of a competent man, he had known that if he quarreled with one employer, he would always be able to find another. Now, he was afraid; he had no right to quit or to seek a job; if he defied an employer, he would be delivered into the unanswerable power of a single Board, and if the Board ruled against him, it would mean being sentenced to the slow death of starvation: it would mean being barred from any employment. He knew that the Board would rule against him; he knew that the key to the dark, capricious mystery of the Board’s contradictory decisions was the secret power of pull. What chance would he have against Mr. Chalmers? There had been a time when the self-interest of his employers had demanded that he exercise his utmost ability. Now, ability was not wanted any longer. There had been a time when he had been required to do his best and rewarded accordingly. Now, he could expect nothing but punishment, if he tried to follow his conscience. There had been a time when he had been expected to think. Now, they did not want him to think, only to obey. They did not want him to have a conscience any longer. Then why should he raise his voice? For whose sake? He thought of the passengers—the three hundred passengers aboard the Comet. He thought of his children. He had a son in high school and a daughter, nineteen, of whom he was fiercely, painfully proud, because she was recognized as the most beautiful girl in town. He asked himself whether he could deliver his children to the fate of the children of the unemployed, as he had seen them in the blighted areas, in the settlements around closed factories and along the tracks of discontinued railroads. He saw, in astonished horror, that the choice which he now had to make was between the lives of his children and the lives of the passengers on the Comet. A conflict of this kind had never been possible before. It was by protecting the safety of the passengers that he had earned the security of his children; he had served one by serving the other; there had been no clash of interests, no call for victims. Now, if he wanted to save the passengers, he had to do it at the price of his children. He remembered dimly the sermons he had heard about the beauty of self-immolation, about the virtue of sacrificing to others that which was one’s dearest. He knew nothing about the philosophy of ethics; but he knew suddenly—not in words, but in the form of a dark, angry, savage pain—that if this was virtue, then he wanted no part of .it.</div>
<div class="tx">He walked into the roundhouse and ordered a large, ancient coal-burning locomotive to be made ready for the run to Winston.</div>
<div class="tx">The trainmaster reached for the telephone in the dispatcher’s office,  to summon an engine crew, as ordered. But his hand stopped, holding the receiver. It struck him suddenly that he was summoning men to their death, and that of the twenty lives listed on the sheet before him, two would be ended by his choice. He felt a physical sensation of cold, nothing more; he felt no concern, only a puzzled, indifferent astonishment. It had never been his job to call men out to die; his job had been to call them out to earn their living. It was strange, he thought; and it was strange that his hand had stopped; what made it stop was like something he would have felt twenty years ago—no, he thought, strange, only one month ago, not longer.</div>
<div class="tx">He was forty-eight years old. He had no family, no friends, no ties to any living being in the world. Whatever capacity for devotion he had possessed, the capacity which others scatter among many random concerns, he had given it whole to the person of his young brother -the brother, his junior by twenty-five years, whom he had brought up. He had sent him through a technological college, and he had known, as had all the teachers, that the boy had the mark of genius on the forehead of his grim, young face. With the same single-tracked devotion as his brother.‘s, the boy had cared for nothing but his studies, not for sports or parties or girls, only for the vision of the things he was going to create as an inventor. He had graduated from college and had gone, on a salary unusual for his age, into the research laboratory of a great electrical concern in Massachusetts.</div>
<div class="tx">This was now May 28, thought the trainmaster. It was on May 1 that Directive 10-289 had been issued. It was on the evening of May 1 that he had been informed that his brother had committed suicide.</div>
<div class="tx">The trainmaster had heard it said that the directive was necessary to save the country. He could not know whether this was true or not; he had no way of knowing what was necessary to save a country. But driven by some feeling which he could not express, he had walked into the office of the editor of the local newspaper and demanded that they publish the story of his brother’s death. “People have to know it,” had been all he could give as his reason. He had been unable to explain that the bruised connections of his mind had formed the wordless conclusion that if this was done by the will of the people, then the people had to know it; he could not believe that they would do it, if they knew. The editor had refused; he had stated that it would be bad for the country’s morale.</div>
<div class="tx">The trainmaster knew nothing about political philosophy; but he knew that that had been the moment when he lost all concern for the life or death of any human being or of the country.</div>
<div class="tx">He thought, holding the telephone receiver, that maybe he should warn the men whom he was about to call. They trusted him; it would never occur to them that he could knowingly send them to their death. But he shook his head: this was only an old thought, last year’s  thought, a remnant of the time when he had trusted them, too. It did not matter now. His brain worked slowly, as if he were dragging his thoughts through a vacuum where no emotion responded to spur them on; he thought that there would be trouble if he warned anyone, there would be some sort of fight and it was he who had to make some great effort to start it. He had forgotten what it was that one started this sort of fight for. Truth? Justice? Brother-love? He did not want to make an effort. He was very tired. If he warned all the men on his list, he thought, there would be no one to run that engine, so he would save two lives and also three hundred lives aboard the Comet. But nothing responded to the figures in his mind; “lives” was just a word, it had no meaning.</div>
<div class="tx">He raised the telephone receiver to his ear, he called two numbers, he summoned an engineer and a fireman to report for duty at once.</div>
<div class="tx">Engine Number 306 had left for Winston, when Dave Mitchum came downstairs. “Get a track motor car ready for me,” he ordered, “I’m going to run up to Fairmount.” Fairmount was a small station, twenty miles east on the line. The men nodded, asking no questions. Bill Brent was not among them. Mitchum walked into Brent’s office. Brent was there, sitting silently at his desk; he seemed to be waiting.</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m going to Fairmount,” said Mitchum; his voice was aggressively too casual, as if implying that no answer was necessary. “They had a Diesel there couple of weeks ago ... you know, emergency repairs or something.... I’m going down to see if we could use it.”</div>
<div class="tx">He paused, but Brent said nothing.</div>
<div class="tx">“The way things stack up,” said Mitchum, not looking at him, “we can’t hold that train till morning. We’ve got to take a chance, one way or another. Now I think maybe this Diesel will do it, but that’s the last one we can try for. So if you don’t hear from me in half an hour, sign the order and send the Comet through with Number 306 to pull her.”</div>
<div class="tx">Whatever Brent had thought, he could not believe it when he heard it. He did not answer at once; then he said, very quietly, “No.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What do you mean, no?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I won’t do it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What do you mean, you won’t? It’s an order!”</div>
<div class="tx">“I won’t do it.” Brent’s voice had the firmness of certainty unclouded by any emotion.</div>
<div class="tx">“Are you refusing to obey an order?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I am.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But you have no right to refuse! And I’m not going to argue about it, either. It’s what I’ve decided, it’s my responsibility and I’m not asking for your opinion. Your job is to take my orders.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Will you give me that order in writing?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why, God damn you, are you hinting that you don’t trust me? Are you ... ?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why do you have to go to Fairmount, Dave? Why can’t you telephone them about that Diesel, if you think that they have one?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re not going to tell me how to do my job! You’re not going to sit there and question me! You’re going to keep your trap shut and do as you’re told or I’ll give you a chance to talk—to the Unification .Board!”</div>
<div class="tx">It was hard to decipher emotions on Brent’s cowboy face, but Mitchum saw something that resembled a look of incredulous horror; only it was horror at some sight of his own, not at the words, and it had no quality of fear, not the kind of fear Mitchum had hoped for.</div>
<div class="tx">Brent knew that tomorrow morning the issue would be his word against Mitchum’s; Mitchum would deny having given the order; Mitchum would show written proof that Engine Number 306 had been sent to Winston only “to stand by,” and would produce witnesses that he had gone to Fairmount in search of a Diesel; Mitchum would claim that the fatal order had been issued by and on the sole responsibility of Bill Brent, the chief dispatcher. It would not be much of a case, not a case that could bear close study, but it would be enough for the Unification Board, whose policy was consistent only in not permitting anything to be studied closely. Brent knew that he could play the same game and pass the frame-up on to another victim, he knew that he had the brains to work it out—except that he would rather be dead than do it.</div>
<div class="tx">It was not the sight of Mitchum that made him sit still in horror. It was the realization that there was no one whom he could call to expose this thing and stop it—no superior anywhere on the line, from Colorado to Omaha to New York. They were in on it, all of them, they were doing the same, they had given Mitchum the lead and the method. It was Dave Mitchum who now belonged on this railroad and he, Bill Brent, who did not.</div>
<div class="tx">As Bill Brent had learned to see, by a single glance at a few numbers on a sheet of paper, the entire trackage of a division—so he was now able to see the whole of his own life and the full price of the decision he was making. He had not fallen in love until he was past his youth; he had been thirty-six when he had found the woman he wanted. He had been engaged to her for the last four years; he had had to wait, because he had a mother to support and a widowed sister with three children. He had never been afraid of burdens, because he had known his ability to carry them, and he had never assumed an obligation unless he was certain that he could fulfill it. He had waited, he had saved his money, and now he had reached the time when he felt himself free to be happy. He was to be married in a few weeks, this coming June. He thought of it, as he sat at his desk, looking at Dave Mitchum, but the thought aroused no hesitation, only regret and a distant sadness—distant, because he knew that he could not let it be part of this moment.</div>
<div class="tx">Bill Brent knew nothing about epistemology; but he knew that man must live by his own rational perception of reality, that he cannot act against it or escape it or find a substitute for it—and that there is no other way for him to live.</div>
<div class="tx">He rose to his feet. “It’s true that so long as I hold this job, I cannot refuse to obey you,” he said. “But I can, if I quit. So I’m quitting.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re <i>what?”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“I’m quitting, as of this moment.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But you have no right to quit, you goddamn bastard! Don’t you know that? Don’t you know that I’ll have you thrown in jail for it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“If you want to send the sheriff for me in the morning, I’ll be at home. I won’t try to escape. There’s no place to go.”</div>
<div class="tx">Dave Mitchum was six-foot-two and had the build of a bruiser, but he stood shaking with fury and terror over the delicate figure of Bill Brent. “You can’t quit! There’s a law against it! I’ve got a law! You can’t walk out on me! I won’t let you out! I won’t let you leave this building tonight!”</div>
<div class="tx">Brent walked to the door. “Will you repeat that order you gave me, in front of the others? No? Then I will.”</div>
<div class="tx">As he pulled the door open, Mitchum’s fist shot out, smashed into his face and knocked him down.</div>
<div class="tx">The trainmaster and the road foreman stood in the open doorway.</div>
<div class="tx">“He quit!” screamed Mitchum. “The yellow bastard quit at a time like this! He’s a law-breaker and a coward!”</div>
<div class="tx">In the slow effort of rising from the floor, through the haze of blood running into his eyes, Bill Brent looked up at the two men. He saw that they understood, but he saw the closed faces of men who did not want to understand, did not want to interfere and hated him for putting them on the spot in the name of justice. He said nothing, rose to his feet and walked out of the building.</div>
<div class="tx">Mitchum avoided looking at the others. “Hey, you,” he called, jerking his head at the night dispatcher across the room. “Come here. You’ve got to take over at once.”</div>
<div class="tx">With the door closed, he repeated to the boy the story of the Diesel at Fairmount, as he had given it to Brent, and the order to send the Comet through with Engine Number 306, if the boy did not hear from him in half an hour. The boy was in no condition to think, to speak or to understand anything: he kept seeing the blood on the face of Bill Brent, who had been his idol. “Yes, sir,” he answered numbly</div>
<div class="tx">Dave Mitchum departed for Fairmount, announcing to every yard-man, switchman and wiper in sight, as he boarded the track motor car that he was going in search of a Diesel for the Comet.</div>
<div class="tx">The night dispatcher sat at his desk, watching the clock and the telephone, praying that the telephone would ring and let him hear from Mr. Mitchum. But the half-hour went by in silence, and whei  there were only three minutes left, the boy felt a terror he could not explain, except that he did not want to send that order.</div>
<div class="tx">He turned to the trainmaster and the road foreman, asking hesitantly, “Mr. Mitchum gave me an order before he left, but I wonder whether I ought to send it, because I ... I don’t think it’s right. He said—”</div>
<div class="tx">The trainmaster turned away; he felt no pity: the boy was about the same age as his brother had been.</div>
<div class="tx">The road foreman snapped, “Do just as Mr. Mitchum told you. You’re not supposed to think,” and walked out of the room.</div>
<div class="tx">The responsibility that James Taggart and Clifton Locey had evaded now rested on the shoulders of a trembling, bewildered boy. He hesitated, then he buttressed his courage with the thought that one did not doubt the good faith and the competence of railroad executives. He did not know that his vision of a railroad and its executives was that of a century ago.</div>
<div class="tx">With the conscientious precision of a railroad man, in the moment when the hand of the clock ended the half-hour, he signed his name to the order instructing the Comet to proceed with Engine Number 306, and transmitted the order to Winston Station.</div>
<div class="tx">The station agent at Winston shuddered when he looked at the order, but he was not the man to defy authority. He told himself that the tunnel was not, perhaps, as dangerous as he thought. He told himself that the best policy, these days, was not to think.</div>
<div class="tx">When he handed their copies of the order to the conductor and the engineer of the Comet, the conductor glanced slowly about the room, from face to face, folded the slip of paper, put it into his pocket and walked out without a word.</div>
<div class="tx">The engineer stood looking at the paper for a moment, then threw it down and said, “I’m not going to do it. And if it’s come to where this railroad hands out orders like this one, I’m not going to work for it, either. Just list me as having quit.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But you can’t quit!” cried the station agent. “They’ll arrest you for it!”</div>
<div class="tx">“If they find me,” said the engineer, and walked out of the station into the vast darkness of the mountain night.</div>
<div class="tx">The engineer from Silver Springs, who had brought in Number 306, was sitting in a corner of the room. He chuckled and said, “He’s yellow.”</div>
<div class="tx">The station agent turned to him. “Will <i>you</i> do it, Joe? Will you take the Comet?”</div>
<div class="tx">Joe Scott was drunk. There had been a time when a railroad man, reporting for duty with any sign of intoxication, would have been regarded as a doctor arriving for work with sores of smallpox on his face. But Joe Scott was a privileged person. Three months ago, he had been  fired for an infraction of safety rules, which had caused a major wreck; two weeks ago, he had been reinstated in his job by order of the Unification Board. He was a friend of Fred Kinnan; he protected Kinnan’s interests in his union, not against the employers, but against the membership.</div>
<div class="tx">“Sure,” said Joe Scott. “I’ll take the Comet. I’ll get her through, if I go fast enough.”</div>
<div class="tx">The fireman of Number 306 had remained in the cab of his engine. He looked up uneasily, when they came to switch his engine to the head end of the Comet; he looked up at the red and green lights of the tunnel, hanging in the distance above twenty miles of curves. But he was a placid, amicable fellow, who made a good fireman with no hope of ever rising to engineer; his husky muscles were his only asset. He felt certain that his superiors knew what they were doing, so he did not venture any questions.</div>
<div class="tx">The conductor stood by the rear end of the Comet. He looked at the lights of the tunnel, then at the long chain of the Comet’s windows. A few windows were lighted, but most of them showed only the feeble blue glow of night lamps edging the lowered blinds. He thought that he should rouse the passengers and warn them. There had been a time when he had placed the safety of the passengers above his own, not by reason of love for his fellow men, but because that responsibility was part of his job, which he accepted and felt pride in fulfilling. Now, he felt a contemptuous indifference and no desire to save them. They had asked for and accepted Directive 10-289, he thought, they went on living and daily turning away in evasion from the kind of verdicts that the Unification Board was passing on defenseless victims—why shouldn’t he now turn away from them? If he saved their lives, not one of them would come forward to defend him when the Unification Board would convict him for disobeying orders, for creating a panic, for delaying Mr. Chalmers. He had no desire to be a martyr for the sake of allowing people safely to indulge in their own irresponsible evil.</div>
<div class="tx">When the moment came, he raised his lantern and signaled the engineer to start.</div>
<div class="tx">“See?” said Kip Chalmers triumphantly to Lester Tuck, as the wheels under their feet shuddered forward. <i>“Fear</i> is the only practical means to deal with people.”</div>
<div class="tx">The conductor stepped onto the vestibule of the last car. No one saw him as he went down the steps of the other side, slipped off the train and vanished into the darkness of the mountains.</div>
<div class="tx">A switchman stood ready to throw the switch that would send the Comet from the siding onto the main track. He looked at the Comet as it came slowly toward him. It was only a blazing white globe with a beam stretching high above his head, and a jerky thunder trembling through the rail under his feet. He knew that the switch should not be thrown. He thought of the night, ten years ago, when he had risked  his life in a flood to save a train from a washout. But he knew that times had changed. In the moment when he threw the switch and saw the headlight jerk sidewise, he knew that he would now hate his job for the rest of his life.</div>
<div class="tx">The Comet uncoiled from the siding into a thin, straight line, and went on into the mountains, with the beam of the headlight like an extended arm pointing the way, and the lighted glass curve of the observation lounge ending it off.</div>
<div class="tx">Some of the passengers aboard the Comet were awake. As the train started its coiling ascent, they saw the small cluster of Winston’s lights at the bottom of the darkness beyond their windows, then the same darkness, but with red and green lights by the hole of a tunnel on the upper edge of the windowpanes. The lights of Winston kept growing smaller, each time they appeared; the black hole of the tunnel kept growing larger. A black veil went streaking past the windows at times, dimming the lights: it was the heavy smoke from the coal-burning engine.</div>
<div class="tx">As the tunnel came closer, they saw, on the edge of the sky far to the south, in a void of space and rock, a spot of living fire twisting in the wind. They did not know what it was and did not care to learn.</div>
<div class="tx">It is said that catastrophes are a matter of pure chance, and there were those who would have said that the passengers of the Comet were not guilty or responsible for the thing that happened to them.</div>
<div class="tx">The man in Bedroom A, Car No. 1, was a professor of sociology who taught that individual ability is of no consequence, that individual effort is futile, that an individual conscience is a useless luxury, that there is no individual mind or character or achievement, that everything is achieved collectively, and that it’s masses that count, not men.</div>
<div class="tx">The man in Roomette 7, Car No. 2, was a journalist who wrote that it is proper and moral to use compulsion “for a good cause,” who believed that he had the right to unleash physical force upon others—to wreck lives, throttle ambitions, strangle desires, violate convictions, to imprison, to despoil, to murder—for the sake of whatever he chose to consider as his own idea of “a good cause,” which did not even have to be an idea, since he had never defined what he regarded as the good, but had merely stated that he went by “a feeling”—a feeling unrestrained by any knowledge, since he considered emotion superior to knowledge and relied solely on his own “good intentions” and on the power of a gun.</div>
<div class="tx">The woman in Roomette 10, Car No. 3, was an elderly school-teacher who had spent her life turning class after class of helpless children into miserable cowards, by teaching them that the will of the majority is the only standard of good and evil, that a majority may do anything it pleases, that they must not assert their own personalities, but must do as others were doing.</div>
<div class="tx">The man in Drawing Room B, Car No. 4, was a newspaper publisher who believed that men are evil by nature and unfit for freedom, that their basic instincts, if left unchecked, are to lie, to rob and to murder one another—and, therefore, men must be ruled by means of lies, robbery and murder, which must be made the exclusive privilege of the rulers, for the purpose of forcing men to work, teaching them to be moral and keeping them within the bounds of order and justice.</div>
<div class="tx">The man in Bedroom H, Car No. 5, was a businessman who had acquired his business, an ore mine, with the help of a government loan, under the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.</div>
<div class="tx">The man in Drawing Room A, Car No. 6, was a financier who had made a fortune by buying “frozen” railroad bonds and getting his friends in Washington to “defreeze” them.</div>
<div class="tx">The man in Seat 5, Car No. 7, was a worker who believed that he had “a right” to a job, whether his employer wanted him or not.</div>
<div class="tx">The woman in Roomette 6, Car No. 8, was a lecturer who believed that, as a consumer, she had “a right” to transportation, whether the railroad people wished to provide it or not.</div>
<div class="tx">The man in Roomette 2, Car No. 9, was a professor of economics who advocated the abolition of private property, explaining that intelligence plays no part in industrial production, that man’s mind is conditioned by material tools, that anybody can run a factory or a railroad and it’s only a matter of seizing the machinery.</div>
<div class="tx">The woman in Bedroom D, Car No. 10, was a mother who had put her two children to sleep in the berth above her, carefully tucking them in, protecting them from drafts and jolts; a mother whose husband held a government job enforcing directives, which she defended by saying, “I don’t care, it’s only the rich that they hurt. After all, I must think of my children.”</div>
<div class="tx">The man in Roomette 3, Car No. 11, was a sniveling little neurotic who wrote cheap little plays into which, as a social message, he inserted cowardly little obscenities to the effect that all businessmen were scoundrels.</div>
<div class="tx">The woman in Roomette 9, Car No. 12, was a housewife who believed that she had the right to elect politicians, of whom she knew nothing, to control giant industries, of which she had no knowledge.</div>
<div class="tx">The man in Bedroom F, Car No. 13, was a lawyer who had said, “Me? I’ll find a way to get along under any political system.”</div>
<div class="tx">The man in Bedroom A, Car No. 14, was a professor of philosophy who taught that there is no mind—<i>how do you know that the tunnel is dangerous?</i>—no reality—<i>how can you prove that the tunnel exists?</i>—no logic—<i>why do you claim that trains cannot move without motive power?</i>—no principles—<i>why should you be bound by the law of cause-and-effect?</i> —no rights—<i>why shouldn’t you attach men to their jobs by force?</i>—no morality—<i>what’s moral about running a railroad?</i>—no absolutes —<i>what difference does it make to you whether you live or die,  anyway?</i> He taught that we know nothing—<i>why oppose the orders of your superiors?</i>—that we can never be certain of anything—<i>how do you know you’re right?</i>—that we must act on the expediency of the moment—<i>you don’t want to risk your job, do you?</i></div>
<div class="tx">The man in Drawing Room B, Car No. 15, was an heir who had inherited his fortune, and who had kept repeating, “Why should Rearden be the only one permitted to manufacture Rearden Metal?”</div>
<div class="tx">The man in Bedroom A, Car No. 16, was a humanitarian who had said, “The men of ability? I do not care what or if they are made to suffer. They must be penalized in order to support the incompetent. Frankly, I do not care whether this is just or not. I take pride in not caring to grant any justice to the able, where mercy to the needy is concerned.”</div>
<div class="tx">These passengers were awake; there was not a man aboard the train who did not share one or more of their ideas. As the train went into the tunnel, the flame of Wyatt’s Torch was the last thing they saw on earth.</div>
