<div class="ct">CHAPTER X</div>
<div class="cst">WYATT’S TORCH</div>
<div class="tx1">“God have mercy on us, ma‘am!” said the clerk of the Hall of Records. “Nobody knows who owns that factory now. I guess nobody will ever know it.”</div>
<div class="tx">The clerk sat at a desk in a ground-floor office, where dust lay undisturbed on the files and few visitors ever called. He looked at the shining automobile parked outside his window, in the muddy square that had once been the center of a prosperous county seat; he looked with a faint, wistful wonder at his two unknown visitors.</div>
<div class="tx">“Why?” asked Dagny.</div>
<div class="tx">He pointed helplessly at the mass of papers he had taken out of the files. “The court will have to decide who owns it, which I don’t think any court can do. If a court ever gets to it. I don’t think it will.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why? What happened?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, it was sold out—the Twentieth Century, I mean. The Twentieth Century Motor Company. It was sold twice, at the same time and to two different sets of owners. That was sort of a big scandal at the time, two years ago, and now it’s just”—he pointed—“just a bunch of paper lying around, waiting for a court hearing. I don’t see how any judge will be able to untangle any property rights out of it—or any right at all.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Would you tell me please just what happened?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, the last legal owner of the factory was The People’s Mortgage Company, of Rome, Wisconsin. That’s the town the other side of the factory, thirty miles north. That Mortgage Company was a sort of noisy outfit that did a lot of advertising about easy credit. Mark Yonts was the head of it. Nobody knew where he came from and nobody knows where he’s gone to now, but what they discovered, the morning after The People’s Mortgage Company collapsed, was that Mark Yonts had sold the Twentieth Century Motor factory to a bunch of suckers from South Dakota, and that he’d also given it as collateral for a loan from a bank in Illinois. And when they took a look at the factory, they discovered that he’d moved all the machinery out and sold it piecemeal, God only knows where and to whom. So it seems like everybody owns the place—and nobody. That’s how it stands now—the South  Dakotans and the bank and the attorney for the creditors of The People’s Mortgage Company all suing one another, all claiming this factory, and nobody having the right to move a wheel in it, except that there’s no wheels left to move.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did Mark Yonts operate the factory before he sold it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Lord, no, ma‘am! He wasn’t the kind that ever operates anything. He didn’t want to <i>make</i> money, only to <i>get</i> it. Guess he got it, too—more than anyone could have made out of that factory.”</div>
<div class="tx">He wondered why the blond, hard-faced man, who sat with the woman in front of his desk, looked grimly out the window at their car, at a large object wrapped in canvas, roped tightly under the raised cover of the car’s luggage compartment.</div>
<div class="tx">“What happened to the factory records?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Which do you mean, ma‘am?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Their production records. Their work records. Their... personnel files.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, there’s nothing left of that now. There’s been a lot of looting going on. All the mixed owners grabbed what furniture or things they could haul out of there, even if the sheriff did put a padlock on the door. The papers and stuff like that—I guess it was all taken by the scavengers from Starnesville, that’s the place down in the valley, where they’re having it pretty tough these days. They burned the stuff for kindling, most likely.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Is there anyone left here who used to work in the factory?” asked Rearden.</div>
<div class="tx">“No, sir. Not around here. They all lived down in Starnesville.”</div>
<div class="tx">“All of them?” whispered Dagny; she was thinking of the ruins. “The ... engineers, too?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, ma‘am. That was the factory town. They’ve all gone, long ago.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you happen to remember the names of any men who worked there?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, ma‘am.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What owner was the last to operate the factory?” asked Rearden.</div>
<div class="tx">“I couldn’t say, sir. There’s been so much trouble up there and the place has changed hands so many times, since old Jed Starnes died. He’s the man who built the factory. He made this whole part of the country, I guess. He died twelve years ago.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Can you give us the names of all the owners since?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, sir. We had a fire in the old courthouse, about three years ago, and all the old records are gone. I don’t know where you could trace them now.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You don’t know how this Mark Yonts happened to acquire the factory?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, I know that. He bought it from Mayor Bascom of Rome. How Mayor Bascom happened to own it, I don’t know.” </div>
<div class="tx">“Where is Mayor Bascom now?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Still there, in Rome.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Thank you very much,” said Rearden, rising. “We’ll call on him.”</div>
<div class="tx">They were at the door when the clerk asked, “What is it you’re looking for, sir?”</div>
<div class="tx">“We’re looking for a friend of ours,” said Rearden. “A friend we’ve lost, who used to work in that factory.”</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="036" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_036_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">Mayor Bascom of Rome, Wisconsin, leaned back in his chair; his chest and stomach formed a pear-shaped outline under his soiled shirt. The air was a mixture of sun and dust, pressing heavily upon the porch of his house. He waved his arm, the ring on his finger flashing a large topaz of poor quality.</div>
<div class="tx">“No use, no use, lady, absolutely no use,” he said. “Would be just a waste of your time, trying to question the folks around here. There’s no factory people left, and nobody that would remember much about them. So many families have moved away that what’s left here is plain no good, if I do say so myself, plain no good, just being Mayor of a bunch of trash.”</div>
<div class="tx">He had offered chairs to his two visitors, but he did not mind it if the lady preferred to stand at the porch railing. He leaned back, studying her long-lined figure; high-class merchandise, he thought; but then, the man with her was obviously rich.</div>
<div class="tx">Dagny stood looking at the streets of Rome. There were houses, sidewalks, lampposts, even a sign advertising soft drinks; but they looked as if it were now only a matter of inches and hours before the town would reach the stage of Starnesville.</div>
<div class="tx">“Naw, there’s no factory records left,” said Mayor Bascom. “If that’s what you want to find, lady, give it up. It’s like chasing leaves in a storm now. Just like leaves in a storm. Who cares about papers? At a time like this, what people save is good, solid, material objects. One’s got to be practical.”</div>
<div class="tx">Through the dusty windowpanes, they could see the living room of his house: there were Persian rugs on a buckled wooden floor, a portable bar with chromium strips against a wall stained by the seepage of last year’s rains, an expensive radio with an old kerosene lamp placed on top of it.</div>
<div class="tx">“Sure, it’s me that sold the factory to Mark Yonts. Mark was a nice fellow, a nice, lively, energetic fellow. Sure, he did trim a few corners, but who doesn’t? Of course, he went a bit too far. That, I didn’t expect. I thought he was smart enough to stay within the law—whatever’s left of it nowadays.”</div>
<div class="tx">Mayor Bascom smiled, looking at them in a manner of placid frankness. His eyes were shrewd without intelligence, his smile good-natured without kindness.</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t think you folks are detectives,” he said, “but even if you were, it wouldn’t matter to me. I didn’t get any rake-off from Mark, he didn’t let me in on any of his deals, I haven’t any idea where he’s gone to now.” He sighed. “I liked that fellow. Wish he’d stayed around. Never mind the Sunday sermons. He had to live, didn’t he? He was no worse than anybody, only smarter. Some get caught at it and some don‘t—that’s the only difference.... Nope, I didn’t know what he was going to do with it, when he bought that factory. Sure, he paid me quite a bit more than the old booby trap was worth. Sure, he was doing me a favor when he bought it. Nope, I didn’t put any pressure on him to make him buy it. Wasn’t necessary. I’d done him a few favors before. There’s plenty of laws that’s sort of made of rubber, and a mayor’s in a position to stretch them a bit for a friend. Well, what the hell? That’s the only way anybody ever gets rich in this world”—he glanced at the luxurious black car—“as you ought to know.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You were telling us about the factory,” said Rearden, trying to control himself.</div>
<div class="tx">“What I can’t stand,” said Mayor Bascom, “is people who talk about principles. No principle ever filled anybody’s milk bottle. The only thing that counts in life is solid, material assets. It’s no time for theories, when everything is falling to pieces around us. Well, me—I don’t aim to go under. Let them keep their ideas and I’ll take the factory. I don’t want ideas, I just want my three square meals a day.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why did you buy that factory?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why does anybody buy any business? To squeeze whatever can be squeezed out of it. I know a good chance when I see it. It was a bankruptcy sale and nobody much who’d want to bid on the old mess. So I got the place for peanuts. Didn’t have to hold it long, either—Mark took it off my hands in two-three months. Sure, it was a smart deal, if I say so myself. No big business tycoon could have done any better with it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Was the factory operating when you took it over?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Naw. It was shut down.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you attempt to reopen it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Not me. I’m a practical person.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Can you recall the names of any men who worked there?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. Never met ‘em.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you move anything out of the factory?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, I’ll tell you. I took a look around—and what I liked was old Jed’s desk. Old Jed Starnes. He was a real big shot in his time. Wonderful desk, solid mahogany. So I carted it home. And some executive, don’t know who he was, had a stall shower in his bathroom, the like of which I never saw. A glass door with a mermaid cut in the glass, real art work, and hot stuff, too, hotter than any oil painting. So I had that shower lifted and moved here. What the hell, I owned it, didn’t I? I was entitled to get something valuable out of that factory.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Whose bankruptcy sale was it, when you bought the factory?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, that was the big crash of the Community National Bank in Madison. Boy, was that a crash! It just about finished the whole state of Wisconsin—sure finished this part of it. Some say it was this motor factory that broke the bank, but others say it was only the last drop in a leaking bucket, because the Community National had bum investments all over three or four states. Eugene Lawson was the head of it. The banker with a heart, they called him. He was quite famous in these parts two-three years ago.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did Lawson operate the factory?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. He merely lent an awful lot of money on it, more than he could ever hope to get back out of the old dump. When the factory busted, that was the last straw for Gene Lawson. The bank busted three months later.” He sighed. “It hit the folks pretty hard around here. They all had their life savings in the Community National.”</div>
<div class="tx">Mayor Bascom looked regretfully past his porch railing at his town. He jerked his thumb at a figure across the street: it was a white-haired charwoman, moving painfully on her knees, scrubbing the steps of a house.</div>
<div class="tx">“See that woman, for instance? They used to be solid, respectable folks. Her husband owned the dry-goods store. He worked all his life to provide for her in her old age, and he did, too, by the time he died—only the money was in the Community National Bank.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who operated the factory when it failed?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, that was some quicky corporation called Amalgamated Service, Inc. Just a puff-ball. Came up out of nothing and went back to it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Where are its members?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Where are the pieces of a puff-ball when it bursts? Try and trace them all over the United States. Try it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Where is Eugene Lawson?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, him? He’s done all right. He’s got a job in Washington—in the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden rose too fast, thrown to his feet by a jolt of anger, then said, controlling himself, “Thank you for the information.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re welcome, friend, you’re welcome,” said Mayor Bascom placidly. “I don’t know what it is you’re after, but take my word for it, give it up. There’s nothing more to be had out of that factory.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I told you that we are looking for a friend of ours.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, have it your way. Must be a pretty good friend, if you’ll go to so much trouble to find him, you and the charming lady who is not your wife.”</div>
<div class="tx">Dagny saw Rearden’s face go white, so that even his lips became a sculptured feature, indistinguishable against his skin. “Keep your dirty —he began, but she stepped between them.</div>
<div class="tx">“Why do you think that I am not his wife?” she asked calmly.</div>
<div class="tx">Mayor Bascom looked astonished by Rearden’s reaction; he had  made the remark without malice, merely like a fellow cheat displaying his shrewdness to his partners in guilt.</div>
<div class="tx">“Lady, I’ve seen a lot in my lifetime,” he said good-naturedly. “Married people don’t look as if they have a bedroom on their minds when they look at each other. In this world, either you’re virtuous or you enjoy yourself. Not both, lady, not both.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’ve asked him a question,” she said to Rearden in time to silence him. “He’s given me an instructive explanation.”</div>
<div class="tx">“If you want a tip, lady,” said Mayor Bascom, “get yourself a wedding ring from the dime store and wear it. It’s not sure fire, but it helps.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Thank you,” she said. “Good-bye.”</div>
<div class="tx">The stern, stressed calm of her manner was a command that made Rearden follow her back to their car in silence.</div>
<div class="tx">They were miles beyond the town when he said, not looking at her, his voice desperate and low, “Dagny, Dagny, Dagny ... I’m sorry!”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m not.”</div>
<div class="tx">Moments later, when she saw the look of control returning to his face, she said, “Don’t ever get angry at a man for stating the truth.”</div>
<div class="tx">“That particular truth was none of his business.”</div>
<div class="tx">“His particular estimate of it was none of your concern or mine.”</div>
<div class="tx">He said through his teeth, not as an answer, but as if the single thought battering his brain turned into sounds against his will, “I couldn’t protect you from that unspeakable little—”</div>
<div class="tx">“I didn’t need protection.”</div>
<div class="tx">He remained silent, not looking at her.</div>
<div class="tx">“Hank, when you’re able to keep down the anger, tomorrow or next week, give some thought to that man’s explanation and see if you recognize any part of it.”</div>
<div class="tx">He jerked his head to glance at her, but said nothing.</div>
<div class="tx">When he spoke, a long time later, it was only to say in a tired, even voice, “We can’t call New York and have our engineers come here to search the factory. We can’t meet them here. We can’t let it be known that we found the motor together.... I had forgotten all that... up there ... in the laboratory.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Let me call Eddie, when we find a telephone. I’ll have him send two engineers from the Taggart staff. I’m here alone, on my vacation, for all they’ll know or have to know.”</div>
<div class="tx">They drove two hundred miles before they found a long-distance telephone line. When she called Eddie Willers, he gasped, hearing her voice.</div>
<div class="tx">“Dagny! For God’s sake, where are you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“In Wisconsin. Why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I didn’t know where to reach you. You’d better come back at once. As fast as you can.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What happened?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Nothing—yet. But there are things going on, which ... You’d better stop them now, if you can. If anybody can.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What things?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Haven’t you been reading the newspapers?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I can’t tell you over the phone. I can’t give you all the details. Dagny, you’ll think I’m insane, but I think they’re planning to kill Colorado.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’ll come back at once,” she said.</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="037" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_037_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">Cut into the granite of Manhattan, under the Taggart Terminal, there were tunnels which had once been used as sidings, at a time when traffic ran in clicking currents through every artery of the Terminal every hour of the day. The need for space had shrunk through the years, with the shrinking of the traffic, and the side tunnels had been abandoned, like dry river beds; a few lights remained as blue patches on the granite over rails left to rust on the ground.</div>
<div class="tx">Dagny placed the remnant of the motor into a vault in one of the tunnels; the vault had once contained an emergency electric generator, which had been removed long ago. She did not trust the useless young men of the Taggart research staff; there were only two engineers of talent among them, who could appreciate her discovery. She had shared her secret with the two and sent them to search the factory in Wisconsin. Then she had hidden the motor where no one else would know of its existence.</div>
<div class="tx">When her workers carried the motor down to the vault and departed, she was about to follow them and lock the steel door, but she stopped, key in hand, as if the silence and solitude had suddenly thrown her at the problem she had been facing for days, as if this were the moment to make her decision.</div>
<div class="tx">Her office car was waiting for her at one of the Terminal platforms, attached to the end of a train due to leave for Washington in a few minutes. She had made an appointment to see Eugene Lawson, but she had told herself that she would cancel it and postpone her quest—if she could think of some action to take against the things she had found on her return to New York, the things Eddie begged her to fight.</div>
<div class="tx">She had tried to think, but she could see no way of fighting, no rules of battle, no weapons. Helplessness was a strange experience, new to her; she had never found it hard to face things and make decisions; but she was not dealing with things—this was a fog without shapes or definitions, in which something kept forming and shifting before it could be seen, like semi-clots in a not-quite-liquid-it was as if her eyes were reduced to side-vision and she were sensing blurs of disaster coiling toward her, but she could not move her glance, she had no glance to move and focus.</div>
<div class="tx">The Union of Locomotive Engineers was demanding that the maximum speed of all trains on the John Galt Line be reduced to sixty miles an hour. The Union of Railway Conductors and Brakemen was demanding that the length of all freight trains on the John Galt Line be reduced to sixty cars.</div>
<div class="tx">The states of Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah and Arizona were demanding that the number of trains run in Colorado not exceed the number of trains run in each of these neighboring states.</div>
<div class="tx">A group headed by Orren Boyle was demanding the passage of a Preservation of Livelihood Law, which would limit the production of Rearden Metal to an amount equal to the output of any other steel mill of equal plant capacity.</div>
<div class="tx">A group headed by Mr. Mowen was demanding the passage of a Fair Share Law to give every customer who wanted it an equal supply of Rearden Metal.</div>
<div class="tx">A group headed by Bertram Scudder was demanding the passage of a Public Stability Law, forbidding Eastern business firms to move out of their states.</div>
<div class="tx">Wesley Mouch, Top Co-ordinator of the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources, was issuing a great many statements, the content and purpose of which could not be defined, except that the words “emergency powers” and “unbalanced economy” kept appearing in the text every few lines.</div>
<div class="tx">“Dagny, by what right?” Eddie Willers had asked her, his voice quiet, but the words sounding like a cry. “By what right are they all doing it? By what right?”</div>
<div class="tx">She had confronted James Taggart in his office and said, “Jim, this is your battle. I’ve fought mine. You’re supposed to be an expert at dealing with the looters. Stop them.”</div>
<div class="tx">Taggart had said, not looking at her, “You can’t expect to run the national economy to suit your own convenience.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t want to run the national economy! I want your national economy runners to leave me alone! I have a railroad to run—and I know what’s going to happen to your national economy if my railroad collapses!”</div>
<div class="tx">“I see no necessity for panic.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Jim, do I have to explain to you that the income from our Rio Norte Line is all we’ve got, to save us from collapsing? That we need every penny of it, every fare, every carload of freight—as fast as we can get it?” He had not answered. “When we have to use every bit of power in every one of our broken-down Diesels, when we don’t have enough of them to give Colorado the service it needs—what’s going to happen if we reduce the speed and the length of trains?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, there’s something to be said for the unions’ viewpoint, too. With so many railroads closing and so many railroad men out of work, they feel that those extra speeds you’ve established on the Rio Norte  Line are unfair—they feel that there should be more trains, instead, so that the work would be divided around—they feel that it’s not fair for us to get all the benefit of that new rail, they want a share of it, too.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who wants a share of it? In payment for what?” He had not answered. “Who’ll bear the cost of two trains doing the work of one?” He had not answered. “Where are you going to get the cars and the engines?” He had not answered. “What are those men going to do after they’ve put Taggart Transcontinental out of existence?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I fully intend to protect the interests of Taggart Transcontinental.”</div>
<div class="tx">“How?” He had not answered. “How—if you kill Colorado?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It seems to me that before we worry about giving some people a chance to expand, we ought to give some consideration to the people who need a chance of bare survival.”</div>
<div class="tx">“If you kill Colorado, what is there going to be left for your damn looters to survive on?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You have always been opposed to every progressive social measure. I seem to remember that you predicted disaster when we passed the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule—but the disaster has not come.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Because <i>I</i> saved you, you rotten fools! I won’t be able to save you this time!” He had shrugged, not looking at her. “And if I don‘t, who will?” He had not answered.</div>
<div class="tx">It did not seem real to her, here, under the ground. Thinking of it here, she knew she could have no part in Jim’s battle. There was no action she could take against the men of undefined thought, of unnamed motives, of unstated purposes, of unspecified morality. There was nothing she could say to them—nothing would be heard or answered. What were the weapons, she thought, in a realm where reason was not a weapon any longer? It was a realm she could not enter. She had to leave it to Jim and count on his self-interest. Dimly, she felt the chill of a thought telling her that self-interest was not Jim’s motive.</div>
<div class="tx">She looked at the object before her, a glass case containing the remnant of the motor. The man who made the motor—she thought suddenly, the thought coming like a cry of despair. She felt a moment’s helpless longing to find him, to lean against him and let him tell her what to do. A mind like his would know the way to win this battle.</div>
<div class="tx">She looked around her. In the clean, rational world of the underground tunnels, nothing was of so urgent an importance as the task of finding the man who made the motor. She thought: Could she delay it in order to argue with Orren Boyle?—to reason with Mr. Mowen?—to plead with Bertram Scudder? She saw the motor, completed, built into an engine that pulled a train of two hundred cars down a track of Rearden Metal at two hundred miles an hour. When the vision was within her reach, within the possible, was she to give it up and spend her time bargaining about sixty miles and sixty cars? She could not descend to an existence where her brain would explode under the pressure of forcing itself not to outdistance incompetence. She could not  function to the rule of: Pipe down—keep down—slow down—don’t do your best, it is not wanted!</div>
<div class="tx">She turned resolutely and left the vault, to take the train for Washington.</div>
<div class="tx">It seemed to her, as she locked the steel door, that she heard a faint echo of steps. She glanced up and down the dark curve of the tunnel. There was no one in sight; there was nothing but a string of blue lights glistening on walls of damp granite.</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="038" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_038_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">Rearden could not fight the gangs who demanded the laws. The choice was to fight them or to keep his mills open. He had lost his supply of iron ore. He had to fight one battle or the other. There was no time for both.</div>
<div class="tx">He had found, on his return, that a scheduled shipment of ore had not been delivered. No word or explanation had been heard from Larkin. When summoned to Rearden’s office, Larkin appeared three days later than the appointment made, offering no apology. He said, not looking at Rearden, his mouth drawn tightly into an expression of tancorous dignity:</div>
<div class="tx">“After all, you can’t order people to come running to your office any time you please.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden spoke slowly and carefully. “Why wasn’t the ore delivered?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I won’t take abuse, I simply won’t take any abuse for something I couldn’t help. I can run a mine just as well as you ran it, every bit as well, I did everything you did—I don’t know why something keeps going wrong unexpectedly all the time. I can’t be blamed for the unexpected.”</div>
<div class="tx">“To whom did you ship your ore last month?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I intended to ship you your share of it, I fully intended it, but I couldn’t help it if we lost ten days of production last month on account of the rainstorm in the whole of north Minnesota—I intended to ship you the ore, so you can’t blame me, because my intention was completely honest.”</div>
<div class="tx">“If one of my blast furnaces goes down, will I be able to keep it going by feeding your intention into it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s why nobody can deal with you or talk to you—because you’re inhuman.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have just learned that for the last three months, you have not been shipping your ore by the lake boats, you have been shipping it by rail. Why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, after all, I have a right to run my business as I see fit.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why are you willing to pay the extra cost?”</div>
<div class="tx">“What do you care? I’m not charging it to you.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What will you do when you find that you can’t afford the rail rates and that you have destroyed the lake shipping?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I am sure you wouldn’t understand any consideration other than dollars and cents, but some people do consider their social and patriotic responsibilities.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What responsibilities?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, I think that a railroad like Taggart Transcontinental is essential to the national welfare and it is one’s public duty to support Jim’s Minnesota branch line, which is running at a deficit.”</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden leaned forward across the desk; he was beginning to see the links of a sequence he had never understood. “To whom did you ship your ore last month?” he asked evenly.</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, after all, that is my private business which—”</div>
<div class="tx">“To Orren Boyle, wasn’t it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You can’t expect people to sacrifice the entire steel industry of the nation to your selfish interests and—”</div>
<div class="tx">“Get out of here,” said Rearden. He said it calmly. The sequence was clear to him now.</div>
<div class="tx">“Don’t misunderstand me, I didn’t mean—”</div>
<div class="tx">“Get out.”</div>
<div class="tx">Larkin got out.</div>
<div class="tx">Then there followed the days and nights of searching a continent by phone, by wire, by plane—of looking at abandoned mines and at mines ready to be abandoned—of tense, rushed conferences held at tables in the unlighted corners of disreputable restaurants. Looking across the table, Rearden had to decide how much he could risk to invest upon the sole evidence of a man’s face, manner and tone of voice, hating the state of having to hope for honesty as for a favor, but risking it, pouring money into unknown hands in exchange for unsupported promises, into unsigned, unrecorded loans to dummy owners of failing mines—money handed and taken furtively, as an exchange between criminals, in anonymous cash; money poured into unenforceable contracts—both parties knowing that in case of fraud, the defrauded was to be punished, not the defrauder—but poured that a stream of ore might continue flowing into furnaces, that the furnaces might continue to pour a stream of white metal.</div>
<div class="tx">“Mr. Rearden,” asked the purchasing manager of his mills, “if you keep that up, where will be your profit?”</div>
<div class="tx">“We’ll make it up on tonnage,” said Rearden wearily. “We have an unlimited market for Rearden Metal.”</div>
<div class="tx">The purchasing manager was an elderly man with graying hair, a lean, dry face, and a heart which, people said, was given exclusively to the task of squeezing every last ounce of value out of a penny. He stood in front of Rearden’s desk, saying nothing else, merely looking straight at Rearden, his cold eyes narrowed and grim. It was a look of the most profound sympathy that Rearden had ever seen.</div>
<div class="tx">There’s no other course open, thought Rearden, as he had thought through days and nights. He knew no weapons but to pay for what he  wanted, to give value for value, to ask nothing of nature without trading his effort in return, to ask nothing of men without trading the product of his effort. What were the weapons, he thought, if values were not a weapon any longer?</div>
<div class="tx">“An unlimited market, Mr. Rearden?” the purchasing manager asked dryly.</div>
<div class="tx">Rearden glanced up at him. “I guess I’m not smart enough to make the sort of deals needed nowadays,” he said, in answer to the unspoken thoughts that hung across his desk.</div>
<div class="tx">The purchasing manager shook his head. “No, Mr. Rearden, it’s one or the other. The same kind of brain can’t do both. Either you’re good at running the mills or you’re good at running to Washington.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Maybe I ought to learn their method.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You couldn’t learn it and it wouldn’t do you any good. You wouldn’t win in any of those deals. Don’t you understand? You’re the one who’s got something to be looted.”</div>
<div class="tx">When he was left alone, Rearden felt a jolt of blinding anger, as it had come to him before, painful, single and sudden like an electric shock—the anger bursting out of the knowledge that one cannot deal with pure evil, with the naked, full-conscious evil that neither has nor seeks justification. But when he felt the wish to fight and kill in the rightful cause of self-defense-he saw the fat, grinning face of Mayor Bascom and heard the drawling voice saying, “... you and the charming lady who is not your wife.”</div>
<div class="tx">Then no rightful cause was left, and the pain of anger was turning into the shameful pain of submission. He had no right to condemn anyone—he thought—to denounce anything, to fight and die joyously, claiming the sanction of virtue. The broken promises, the unconfessed desires, the betrayal, the deceit, the lies, the fraud—he was guilty of them all. What form of corruption could he scorn? Degrees do not matter, he thought; one does not bargain about inches of evil.</div>
<div class="tx">He did not know—as he sat slumped at his desk, thinking of the honesty he could claim no longer, of the sense of justice he had lost—that it was his rigid honesty and ruthless sense of justice that were now knocking his only weapon out of his hands. He would fight the looters, but the wrath and fire were gone. He would fight, but only as one guilty wretch against the others. He did not pronounce the words, but the pain was their equivalent, the ugly pain saying: Who am I to cast the first stone?</div>
<div class="tx">He let his body fall across the desk.... Dagny, he thought, Dagny, if this is the price I have to pay, I’ll pay it.... He was still the trader who knew no code except that of full payment for his desires.</div>
<div class="tx">It was late when he came home and hurried soundlessly up the stairs to his bedroom. He hated himself for being reduced to sneaking, but he had done it on most of his evenings for months. The sight of his family dad become unbearable to him; he could not tell why. Don’t hate them  for your own guilt, he had told himself, but knew dimly that this was not the root of his hatred.</div>
<div class="tx">He closed the door of his bedroom like a fugitive winning a moment’s reprieve. He moved cautiously, undressing for bed: he wanted no sound to betray his presence to his family, he wanted no contact with them, not even in their own minds.</div>
<div class="tx">He had put on his pajamas and stopped to light a cigarette, when the door of his bedroom opened. The only person who could properly enter his room without knocking had never volunteered to enter it, so he stared blankly for a moment before he was able to believe that it was Lillian who came in.</div>
<div class="tx">She wore an Empire garment of pale chartreuse, its pleated skirt streaming gracefully from its high waistline; one could not tell at first glance whether it was an evening gown or a negligee; it was a negligee. She paused in the doorway, the lines of her body flowing into an attractive silhouette against the light.</div>
<div class="tx">“I know I shouldn’t introduce myself to a stranger,” she said softly, “but I’ll have to: my name is Mrs. Rearden.” He could not tell whether it was sarcasm or a plea.</div>
<div class="tx">She entered and threw the door closed with a casual, imperious gesture, the gesture of an owner.</div>
<div class="tx">“What is it, Lillian?” he asked quietly.</div>
<div class="tx">“My dear, you mustn’t confess so much so bluntly”—she moved in a leisurely manner across the room, past his bed, and sat down in an armchair—“and so unflatteringly. It’s an admission that I need to show special cause for taking your time. Should I make an appointment through your secretary?”</div>
<div class="tx">He stood in the middle of the room, holding the cigarette at his lips, looking at her, volunteering no answer.</div>
<div class="tx">She laughed. “My reason is so unusual that I know it will never occur to you: loneliness, darling. Do you mind throwing a few crumbs of your expensive attention to a beggar? Do you mind if I stay here without any formal reason at all?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No,” he said quietly, “not if you wish to.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have nothing weighty to discuss—no million-dollar orders, no transcontinental deals, no rails, no bridges. Not even the political situation. I just want to chatter like a woman about perfectly unimportant things.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Go ahead.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Henry, there’s no better way to stop me, is there?” She had an air of helpless, appealing sincerity. “What can I say after that? Suppose I wanted to tell you about the new novel which Balph Eubank is writing—he is dedicating it to me—would that interest you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“If it’s the truth that you want—not in the least.”</div>
<div class="tx">She laughed. “And if it’s not the truth that I want?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then I wouldn’t know what to say,” he answered—and felt a rush  of blood to his brain, tight as a slap, realizing suddenly the double infamy of a lie uttered in protestation of honesty; he had said it sincerely, but it implied a boast to which he had no right any longer. “Why would you want it, if it’s not the truth?” he asked. “What for?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Now you see, <i>that’s</i> the cruelty of conscientious people. You wouldn’t understand it—would you?—if I answered that real devotion consists of being willing to lie, cheat and fake in order to make another person happy—to create for him the reality he wants, if he doesn’t like the one that exists.”</div>
<div class="tx">“No,” he said slowly, “I wouldn’t understand it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s really very simple. If you tell a beautiful woman that she is beautiful, what have you given her? It’s no more than a fact and it has cost you nothing. But if you tell an ugly woman that she is beautiful, you offer her the great homage of corrupting the concept of beauty. To love a woman for her virtues is meaningless. She’s earned it, it’s a payment, not a gift. But to love her for her vices is a real gift, unearned and undeserved. To love her for her vices is to defile all virtue for her sake—and <i>that</i> is a real tribute of love, because you sacrifice your conscience, your reason, your integrity and your invaluable self-esteem.”</div>
<div class="tx">He looked at her blankly. It sounded like some sort of monstrous corruption that precluded the possibility of wondering whether anyone could mean it; he wondered only what was the point of uttering it.</div>
<div class="tx">“What’s love, darling, if it’s not self-sacrifice?” she went on lightly, in the tone of a drawing-room discussion. “What’s self-sacrifice, unless one sacrifices that which is one’s most precious and most important? But I don’t expect you to understand it. Not a stainless-steel Puritan like you. That’s the immense selfishness of the Puritan. You’d let the whole world perish rather than soil that immaculate self of yours with a single spot of which you’d have to be ashamed.”</div>
<div class="tx">He said slowly, his voice oddly strained and solemn, “I have never claimed to be immaculate.”</div>
<div class="tx">She laughed. “And what is it you’re being right now? You’re giving me an honest answer, aren’t you?” She shrugged her naked shoulders. “Oh, darling, don’t take me seriously! I’m just talking.”</div>
<div class="tx">He ground his cigarette into an ashtray; he did not answer.</div>
<div class="tx">“Darling,” she said, “I actually came here only because I kept thinking that I had a husband and I wanted to find out what he looked like.”</div>
<div class="tx">She studied him as he stood across the room, the tall, straight, taut lines of his body emphasized by the single color of the dark blue pajamas.</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re very attractive,” she said. “You look so much better—these last few months. Younger. Should I say happier? You look less tense. Oh, I know you’re rushed more than ever and you act like a commander in an air raid, but that’s only the surface. You’re less tense—inside.”</div>
<div class="tx">He looked at her, astonished. It was true; he had not known it, had  not admitted it to himself. He wondered at her power of observation. She had seen little of him in these last few months. He had not entered her bedroom since his return from Colorado. He had thought that she would welcome their isolation from each other. Now he wondered what motive could have made her so sensitive to a change in him—unless it was a feeling much greater than he had ever suspected her of experiencing.</div>
<div class="tx">“I was not aware of it,” he said.</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s quite becoming, dear—and astonishing, since you’ve been having such a terribly difficult time.”</div>
<div class="tx">He wondered whether this was intended as a question. She paused, as if waiting for an answer, but she did not press it and went on gaily:</div>
<div class="tx">“I know you’re having all sorts of trouble at the mills—and then the political situation is getting to be ominous, isn’t it? If they pass those laws they’re talking about, it will hit you pretty hard, won’t it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes. It will. But that is a subject which is of no interest to <i>you,</i> Lillian, is it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, but it is!” She raised her head and looked straight at him; her eyes had the blank, veiled look he had seen before, a look of deliberate mystery and of confidence in his inability to solve it. “It is of great interest to me ... though not because of any possible financial losses,” she added softly.</div>
<div class="tx">He wondered, for the first time, whether her spite, her sarcasm, the cowardly manner of delivering insults under the protection of a smile, were not the opposite of what he had always taken them to be—not a method of torture, but a twisted form of despair, not a desire to make him suffer, but a confession of her own pain, a defense for the pride of an unloved wife, a secret plea—so that the subtle, the hinted, the evasive in her manner, the thing begging to be understood, was not the open malice, but the hidden love. He thought of it, aghast. It made his guilt greater than he had ever contemplated.</div>
<div class="tx">“If we’re talking politics, Henry, I had an amusing thought. The side you represent—what is that slogan you all use so much, the motto you’re supposed to stand for? ‘The sanctity of contract’—is that it?”</div>
<div class="tx">She saw his swift glance, the intentness of his eyes, the first response of something she had struck, and she laughed aloud.</div>
<div class="tx">“Go on,” he said; his voice was low; it had the sound of a threat.</div>
<div class="tx">“Darling, what for?—since you understood me quite well.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What was it you intended to say?” His voice was harshly precise and without any color of feeling.</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you really wish to bring me to the humiliation of complaining? It’s so trite and such a common complaint—although I did think I had a husband who prides himself on being different from lesser men. Do you want me to remind you that you once swore to make my happiness the aim of your life? And that you can’t really say in all honesty  whether I’m happy or unhappy, because you haven’t even inquired whether I exist?”</div>
<div class="tx">He felt them as a physical pain—all the things that came tearing at him impossibly together. Her words were a plea, he thought—and he felt the dark, hot flow of guilt. He felt pity—the cold ugliness of pity without affection. He felt a dim anger, like a voice he tried to choke, a voice crying in revulsion: Why should I deal with her rotten, twisted lying?—why should I accept torture for the sake of pity?—why is it I who should have to take the hopeless burden of trying to spare a feeling she won’t admit, a feeling I can’t know or understand or try to guess? -if she loves me, why doesn’t the damn coward say so and let us both face it in the open? He heard another, louder voice, saying evenly: Don’t switch the blame to her, that’s the oldest trick of all cowards—<i>you’re</i> guilty—no matter what she does, it’s nothing compared to your guilt—she’s right—it makes you sick, doesn’t it, to know it’s she who’s right?—let it make you sick, you damn adulterer—it’s she who’s right!</div>
<div class="tx">“What would make you happy, Lillian?” he asked. His voice was toneless.</div>
<div class="tx">She smiled, leaning back in her chair, relaxing; she had been watching his face intently.</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, dear!” she said, as in bored amusement. “That’s the shyster question. The loophole. The escape clause.”</div>
<div class="tx">She got up, letting her arms fall with a shrug, stretching her body in a limp, graceful gesture of helplessness.</div>
<div class="tx">“What would make me happy, Henry? That is what <i>you</i> ought to tell me. That is what you should have discovered for me. I don’t know. You were to create it and offer it to me. That was your trust, your obligation, your responsibility. But you won’t be the first man to default on that promise. It’s the easiest of all debts to repudiate. Oh, you’d never welsh on a payment for a load of iron ore delivered to you. Only on a life.”</div>
<div class="tx">She was moving casually across the room, the green-yellow folds of her skirt coiling in long waves about her.</div>
<div class="tx">“I know that claims of this kind are impractical,” she said. “I have no mortgage on you, no collateral, no guns, no chains. I have no hold on you at all, Henry—nothing but your honor.”</div>
<div class="tx">He stood looking at her as if it took all of his effort to keep his eyes directed at her face, to keep seeing her, to endure the sight. “What do you want?” he asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“Darling, there are so many things you could guess by yourself, if you really wished to know what I want. For instance, if you have been avoiding me so blatantly for months, wouldn’t I want to know the reason?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have been very busy.”</div>
<div class="tx">She shrugged. “A wife expects to be the first concern of her husband’s  existence. I didn’t know that when you swore to forsake all others, it didn’t include blast furnaces.”</div>
<div class="tx">She came closer and, with an amused smile that seemed to mock them both, she slipped her arms around him.</div>
<div class="tx">It was the swift, instinctive, ferocious gesture of a young bridegroom at the unrequested contact of a whore—the gesture with which he tore her arms off his body and threw her aside.</div>
<div class="tx">He stood, paralyzed, shocked by the brutality of his own reaction. She was staring at him, her face naked in bewilderment, with no mystery, no pretense or protection; whatever calculations she had made, this was a thing she had not expected.</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m sorry, Lillian ...” he said, his voice low, a voice of sincerity and of suffering.</div>
<div class="tx">She did not answer.</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m sorry ... It’s just that I’m very tired,” he added, his voice lifeless; he was broken by the triple lie, one part of which was a disloyalty he could not bear to face; it was not the disloyalty to Lillian.</div>
<div class="tx">She gave a brief chuckle. “Well, if that’s the effect your work has on you, I may come to approve of it. Do forgive me, I was merely trying to do my duty. I thought that you were a sensualist who’d never rise above the instincts of an animal in the gutter. I’m not one of those bitches who belong in it.” She was snapping the words dryly, absently, without thinking. Her mind was on a question mark, racing over every possible answer.</div>
<div class="tx">It was her last sentence that made him face her suddenly, face her simply, directly, not as one on the defensive any longer. “Lillian, what purpose do you live for?” he asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“What a crude question! No enlightened person would ever ask it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, what is it that enlightened people do with their lives?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Perhaps they do not attempt to do anything. <i>That</i> is their enlightenment.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What do they do with their time?”</div>
<div class="tx">“They certainly don’t spend it on manufacturing plumbing pipes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Tell me, why do you keep making those cracks? I know that you feel contempt for the plumbing pipes. You’ve made that clear long ago. Your contempt means nothing to me. Why keep repeating it?”</div>
<div class="tx">He wondered why this hit her; he did not know in what manner, but he knew that it did. He wondered why he felt with absolute certainty that <i>that</i> had been the right thing to say.</div>
<div class="tx">She asked, her voice dry, “What’s the purpose of the sudden questionnaire?”</div>
<div class="tx">He answered simply, “I’d like to know whether there’s anything that you really want. If there is, I’d like to give it to you, if I can.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’d like to <i>buy</i> it? That’s all you know—<i>paying</i> for things. You get off easily, don’t you? No, it’s not as simple as that. What I want is non-material.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What is it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You.”</div>
<div class="tx">“How do you mean that, Lillian? You don’t mean it in the gutter sense.”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, not in the gutter sense.”</div>
<div class="tx">“How, then?”</div>
<div class="tx">She was at the door, she turned, she raised her head to look at him and smiled coldly.</div>
<div class="tx">“You wouldn’t understand it,” she said and walked out.</div>
<div class="tx">The torture remaining to him was the knowledge that she would never want to leave him and he would never have the right to leave—the thought that he owed her at least the feeble recognition of sympathy, of respect for a feeling he could neither understand nor return—the knowledge that he could summon nothing for her, except contempt, a strange, total, unreasoning contempt, impervious to pity, to reproach, to his own pleas for justice—and, hardest to bear, the proud revulsion against his own verdict, against his demand that he consider himself lower than this woman he despised.</div>
<div class="tx">Then it did not matter to him any longer, it all receded into some outer distance, leaving only the thought that he was willing to bear anything—leaving him in a state which was both tension and peace—because he lay in bed, his face pressed to the pillow, thinking of Dagny, of her slender, sensitive body stretched beside him, trembling under the touch of his fingers. He wished she were back in New York. If she were, he would have gone there, now, at once, in the middle of the night.</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="039" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_039_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">Eugene Lawson sat at his desk as if it were the control panel of a bomber plane commanding a continent below. But he forgot it, at times, and slouched down, his muscles going slack inside his suit, as if he were pouting at the world. His mouth was the one part of him which he could not pull tight at any time; it was uncomfortably prominent in his lean face, attracting the eyes of any listener: when he spoke, the movement ran through his lower lip, twisting its moist flesh into extraneous contortions of its own.</div>
<div class="tx">“I am not ashamed of it,” said Eugene Lawson. “Miss Taggart, I want you to know that I am not ashamed of my past career as president of the Community National Bank of Madison.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I haven’t made any reference to shame,” said Dagny coldly.</div>
<div class="tx">“No moral guilt can be attached to me, inasmuch as I lost everything I possessed in the crash of that bank. It seems to me that I would have the right to feel proud of such a sacrifice.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I merely wanted to ask you some questions about the Twentieth Century Motor Company which—”</div>
<div class="tx">“I shall be glad to answer any questions. I have nothing to hide. My  conscience is clear. If you thought that the subject was embarrassing to me, you were mistaken.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I wanted to inquire about the men who owned the factory at the time when you made a loan to—”</div>
<div class="tx">“They were perfectly good men. They were a perfectly sound risk—though, of course, I am speaking in human terms, not in the terms of cold cash, which you are accustomed to expect from bankers. I granted them the loan for the purchase of that factory, because they needed the money. If people needed money, that was enough for me. Need was my standard, Miss Taggart. Need, not greed. My father and grandfather built up the Community National Bank just to amass a fortune for themselves. I placed their fortune in the service of a higher ideal. I did not sit on piles of money and demand collateral from poor people who needed loans. The heart was my collateral. Of course, I do not expect anyone in this materialistic country to understand me. The rewards I got were not of a kind that people of <i>your</i> class, Miss Taggart, would appreciate. The people who used to sit in front of my desk at the bank, did not sit as you do, Miss Taggart. They were humble, uncertain, worn with care, afraid to speak. My rewards were the tears of gratitude in their eyes, the trembling voices, the blessings, the woman who kissed my hand when I granted her a loan she had begged for in vain everywhere else.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Will you please tell me the names of the men who owned the motor factory?”</div>
<div class="tx">“That factory was essential to the region, absolutely essential. I was perfectly justified in granting that loan. It provided employment for thousands of workers who had no other means of livelihood.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you know any of the people who worked in the factory?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Certainly. I knew them all. It was men that interested me, not machines. I was concerned with the human side of industry, not the cash-register side.”</div>
<div class="tx">She leaned eagerly across the desk. “Did you know any of the engineers who worked there?”</div>
<div class="tx">“The engineers? No, no. I was much more democratic than that. It’s the real workers that interested me. The common men. They all knew me by sight. I used to come into the shops and they would wave and shout, ‘Hello, Gene.’ That’s what they called me—Gene. But I’m sure this is of no interest to you. It’s past history. Now if you really came to Washington in order to talk to me about your railroad”—he straightened up briskly, the bomber-plane pose returning—“I don’t know whether I can promise you any special consideration, inasmuch as I must hold the national welfare above any private privileges or interests which—”</div>
<div class="tx">“I didn’t come to talk to you about my railroad,” she said, looking at him in bewilderment. “I have no desire to talk to you about my railroad.”</div>
<div class="tx">“No?” He sounded disappointed.</div>
<div class="tx">“No. I came for information about the motor factory. Could you possibly recall the names of any of the engineers who worked there?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t believe I ever inquired about their names. I wasn’t concerned with the parasites of office and laboratory. I was concerned with the real workers—the men of calloused hands who keep a factory going. They were my friends.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Can you give me a few of their names? Any names, of anyone who worked there?”</div>
<div class="tx">“My dear Miss Taggart, it was so long ago, there were thousands of them, how can I remember?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Can’t you recall one, any one?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I certainly cannot. So many people have always filled my life that I can’t be expected to recall individual drops in the ocean.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Were you familiar with the production of that factory? With the kind of work they were doing—or planning?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Certainly. I took a personal interest in all my investments. I went to inspect that factory very often. They were doing exceedingly well. They were accomplishing wonders. The workers’ housing conditions were the best in the country. I saw lace curtains at every window and flowers on the window sills. Every home had a plot of ground for a garden. They had built a new schoolhouse for the children.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you know anything about the work of the factory’s research laboratory?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, yes, they had a wonderful research laboratory, very advanced, very dynamic, with forward vision and great plans.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you ... remember hearing anything about... any plans to produce a new type of motor?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Motor? What motor, Miss Taggart? I had no time for details. My objective was social progress, universal prosperity, human brotherhood and love. Love, Miss Taggart. That is the key to everything. If men learned to love one another, it would solve all their problems.”</div>
<div class="tx">She turned away, not to see the damp movements of his mouth.</div>
<div class="tx">A chunk of stone with Egyptian hieroglyphs lay on a pedestal in a corner of the office—the statue of a Hindu goddess with six spider arms stood in a niche—and a huge graph of bewildering mathematical detail, like the sales chart of a mail-order house, hung on the wall.</div>
<div class="tx">“Therefore, if you’re thinking of your railroad, Miss Taggart—as, of course, you are, in view of certain possible developments—I must point out to you that although the welfare of the country is my first consideration, to which I would not hesitate to sacrifice anyone’s profits, still, I have never closed my ears to a plea for mercy and—”</div>
<div class="tx">She looked at him and understood what it was that he wanted from her, what sort of motive kept him going.</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t wish to discuss my railroad,” she said, fighting to keep her voice monotonously flat, while she wanted to scream in revulsion. “Anything you have to say on the subject, you will please say it to my brother, Mr. James Taggart.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’d think that at a time like this you wouldn’t want to pass up a rare opportunity to plead your case before—”</div>
<div class="tx">“Have you preserved any records pertaining to the motor factory?” She sat straight, her hands clasped tight together.</div>
<div class="tx">“What records? I believe I told you that I lost everything I owned when the bank collapsed.” His body had gone slack once more, his interest had vanished. “But I do not mind it. What I lost was mere material wealth. I am not the first man in history to suffer for an ideal. I was defeated by the selfish greed of those around me. I couldn’t establish a system of brotherhood and love in just one small state, amidst a nation of profit-seekers and dollar-grubbers. It was not my fault. But I won’t let them beat me. I am not to be stopped. I am fighting—on a wider scale—for the privilege of serving my fellow men. Records, Miss Taggart? The record I left, when I departed from Madison, is inscribed in the hearts of the poor, who had never had a chance before.”</div>
<div class="tx">She did not want to utter a single unnecessary word; but she could not stop herself: she kept seeing the figure of the old charwoman scrubbing the steps. “Have you seen that section of the country since?” she asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s not my fault!” he yelled. “It’s the fault of the rich who still had money, but wouldn’t sacrifice it to save my bank and the people of Wisconsin! You can’t blame me! I lost everything!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Mr. Lawson,” she said with effort, “do you perhaps recall the name of the man who headed the corporation that owned the factory? The corporation to which you lent the money. It was called Amalgamated Service, wasn’t it? Who was its president?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, him? Yes, I remember him. His name was Lee Hunsacker. A very worthwhile young man, who’s taken a terrible beating.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Where is he now? Do you know his address?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why—I believe he’s somewhere in Oregon. Grangeville, Oregon. My secretary can give you his address. But I don’t see of what interest ... Miss Taggart, if what you have in mind is to try to see Mr. Wesley Mouch, let me tell you that Mr. Mouch attaches a great deal of weight to my opinion in matters affecting such issues as railroads and other—”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have no desire to see Mr. Mouch,” she said, rising.</div>
<div class="tx">“But then, I can’t understand ... What, really, was your purpose in coming here?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I am trying to find a certain man who used to work for the Twentieth Century Motor Company.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why do you wish to find him?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I want him to work for my railroad.”</div>
<div class="tx">He spread his arms wide, looking incredulous and slightly indignant. “At such a moment, when crucial issues hang in the balance, you  choose to waste your time on looking for some one employee? Believe me, the fate of your railroad depends on Mr. Mouch much more than on any employee you ever find.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Good day,” she said.</div>
<div class="tx">She had turned to go, when he said, his voice jerky and high, “You haven’t any right to despise me.”</div>
<div class="tx">She stopped to look at him. “I have expressed no opinion.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I am perfectly innocent, since I lost my money, since I lost all of my own money for a good cause. My motives were pure. I wanted nothing for myself. I’ve never sought anything for myself. Miss Taggart, I can proudly say that in all of my life I have <i>never</i> made a profit!”</div>
<div class="tx">Her voice was quiet, steady and solemn:</div>
<div class="tx">“Mr. Lawson, I think I should let you know that of all the statements a man can make, <i>that</i> is the one I consider most despicable.”</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="040" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_040_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">“I never had a chance!” said Lee Hunsacker.</div>
<div class="tx">He sat in the middle of the kitchen, at a table cluttered with papers. He needed a shave; his shirt needed laundering. It was hard to judge his age: the swollen flesh of his face looked smooth and blank, untouched by experience; the graying hair and filmy eyes looked worn by exhaustion; he was forty-two.</div>
<div class="tx">“Nobody ever gave me a chance. I hope they’re satisfied with what they’ve made of me. But don’t think that I don’t know it. I know I was cheated out of my birthright. Don’t let them put on any airs about how kind they are. They’re a stinking bunch of hypocrites.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who?” asked Dagny.</div>
<div class="tx">“Everybody,” said Lee Hunsacker. “People are bastards at heart and it’s no use pretending otherwise. Justice? Huh! Look at it!” His arm swept around him. “A man like me reduced to this!”</div>
<div class="tx">Beyond the window, the light of noon looked like grayish dusk among the bleak roofs and naked trees of a place that was not country and could never quite become a town. Dusk and dampness seemed soaked into the walls of the kitchen. A pile of breakfast dishes lay in the sink; a pot of stew simmered on the stove, emitting steam with the greasy odor of cheap meat; a dusty typewriter stood among the papers on the table.</div>
<div class="tx">“The Twentieth Century Motor Company,” said Lee Hunsacker, “was one of the most illustrious names in the history of American industry. <i>I</i> was the president of that company. I owned that factory. But they wouldn’t give me a chance.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You were not the president of the Twentieth Century Motor Company, were you? I believe you headed a corporation called Amalgamated Service?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, yes, but it’s the same thing. We took over their factory. We were going to do just as well as they did. Better. We were just as important. Who the hell was Jed Starnes anyway? Nothing but a backwoods garage mechanic—did you know that that’s how he started?—without any background at all. My family once belonged to the New York Four Hundred. My grandfather was a member of the national legislature. It’s not my fault that my father couldn’t afford to give me a car of my own, when he sent me to school. All the other boys had cars. My family name was just as good as any of theirs. When I went to college—” He broke off abruptly. “What newspaper did you say you’re from?”</div>
<div class="tx">She had given him her name; she did not know why she now felt glad that he had not recognized it and why she preferred not to enlighten him. “I did not say I was from a newspaper,” she answered. “I need some information on that motor factory for a private purpose of my own, not for publication.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh.” He looked disappointed. He went on sullenly, as if she were guilty of a deliberate offense against him. “I thought maybe you came for an advance interview because I’m writing my autobiography.” He pointed to the papers on the table. “And what I intend to tell is plenty. I intend—Oh, hell!” he said suddenly, remembering something.</div>
<div class="tx">He rushed to the stove, lifted the lid off the pot and went through the motions of stirring the stew, hatefully, paying no attention to his performance. He flung the wet spoon down on the stove, letting the grease drip into the gas burners, and came back to the table.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yeah, I’ll write my autobiography <i>if</i> anybody ever gives me a chance,” he said. “How can I concentrate on serious work when this is the sort of thing I have to do?” He jerked his head at the stove. “Friends, huh! Those people think that just because they took me in, they can exploit me like a Chinese coolie! Just because I had no other place to go. They have it easy, those good old friends of mine. He never lifts a finger around the house, just sits in his store all day; a lousy little two-bit stationery store—can it compare in importance with the book I’m writing? And she goes out shopping and asks me to watch her damn stew for her. She knows that a writer needs peace and concentration, but does she care about that? Do you know what she did today?” He leaned confidentially across the table, pointing at the dishes in the sink. “She went to the market and left all the breakfast dishes there and said she’d do them later. I know what she wanted. She expected me to do them. Well, I’ll fool her. I’ll leave them just where they are.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Would you allow me to ask you a few questions about the motor factory<sup>?</sup>”</div>
<div class="tx">“Don’t imagine that that motor factory was the only thing in my life. I’d held many important positions before. I was prominently connected, at various times, with enterprises manufacturing surgical appliances, paper containers, men’s hats and vacuum cleaners. Of course, that sort of stuff didn’t give me much scope. But the motor factory—<i>that w</i>as my big chance. That was what I’d been waiting for.”</div>
<div class="tx">“How did you happen to acquire it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It was meant for me. It was my dream come true. The factory was shut down—bankrupt. The heirs of Jed Starnes had run it into the ground pretty fast. I don’t know exactly what it was, but there had been something goofy going on up there, so the company went broke. The railroad people closed their branch line. Nobody wanted the place, nobody would bid on it. But there it was, this great factory, with all the equipment, all the machinery, all the things that had made millions for Jed Starnes. That was the kind of setup I wanted, the kind of opportunity I was entitled to. So I got a few friends together and we formed the Amalgamated Service Corporation and we scraped up a little money. But we didn’t have enough, we needed a loan to help us out and give us a start. It was a perfectly safe bet, we were young men embarking on great careers, full of eagerness and hope for the future. But do you think anybody gave us any encouragement? They did not. Not those greedy, entrenched vultures of privilege! How were we to succeed in life if nobody would give us a factory? We couldn’t compete against the little snots who inherit whole chains of factories, could we? Weren’t we entitled to the same break? Aw, don’t let me hear anything about justice! I worked like a dog, trying to get somebody to lend us the money. But that bastard Midas Mulligan put me through the wringer.”</div>
<div class="tx">She sat up straight. “Midas Mulligan?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yeah—the banker who looked like a truck driver and acted it, too!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you know Midas Mulligan?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did I know him? I’m the only man who ever beat him—not that it did me any good!”</div>
<div class="tx">At odd moments, with a sudden sense of uneasiness, she had wondered—as she wondered about the stories of deserted ships found floating at sea or of sourceless lights flashing in the sky—about the disappearance of Midas Mulligan. There was no reason why she felt that she had to solve these riddles, except that they were mysteries which had no business being mysteries: they could not be causeless, yet no known cause could explain them.</div>
<div class="tx">Midas Mulligan had once been the richest and, consequently, the most denounced man in the country. He had never taken a loss on any investment he made; everything he touched turned into gold. “It’s because I know what to touch,” he said. Nobody could grasp the pattern of his investments: he rejected deals that were considered flawlessly safe, and he put enormous amounts into ventures that no other banker would handle. Through the years, he had been the trigger that had sent unexpected, spectacular bullets of industrial success shooting over the country. It was he who had invested in Rearden Steel at its start, thus helping Rearden to complete the purchase of the abandoned steel mills in Pennsylvania. When an economist referred to him once as an audacious gambler, Mulligan said, “The reason why you’ll never get rich is because you think that what I do is gambling.”</div>
<div class="tx">It was rumored that one had to observe a certain unwritten rule when dealing with Midas Mulligan: if an applicant for a loan ever mentioned his personal need or any personal feeling whatever, the interview ended and he was never given another chance to speak to Mr. Mulligan.</div>
<div class="tx">“Why yes, I can,” said Midas Mulligan, when he was asked whether he could name a person more evil than the man with a heart closed to pity. “The man who uses another’s pity for him as a weapon.”</div>
<div class="tx">In his long career, he had ignored all the public attacks on him, except one. His first name had been Michael; when a newspaper columnist of the humanitarian clique nicknamed him Midas Mulligan and the tag stuck to him as an insult, Mulligan appeared in court and petitioned for a legal change of his first name to “Midas.” The petition was granted.</div>
<div class="tx">In the eyes of his contemporaries, he was a man who had committed the one unforgivable sin: he was proud of his wealth.</div>
<div class="tx">These were the things Dagny had heard about Midas Mulligan; she had never met him. Seven years ago, Midas Mulligan had vanished. He left his home one morning and was never heard from again. On the next day, the depositors of the Mulligan Bank in Chicago received notices requesting that they withdraw their funds, because the bank was closing. In the investigations that followed, it was learned that Mulligan had planned the closing in advance and in minute detail; his employees were merely carrying out his instructions. It was the most orderly run on a bank that the country ever witnessed. Every depositor received his money down to the last fraction of interest due. All of the bank’s assets had been sold piecemeal to various financial institutions. When the books were balanced, it was found that they balanced perfectly, to the penny; nothing was left over; the Mulligan Bank had been wiped out.</div>
<div class="tx">No clue was ever found to Mulligan’s motive, to his personal fate or to the many millions of his personal fortune. The man and the fortune vanished as if they had never existed. No one had had any warning about his decision, and no events could be traced to explain it. If he had wished to retire—people wondered—why hadn’t he sold his establishment at a huge profit, as he could have done, instead of destroying it? There was nobody to give an answer. He had no family, no friends. His servants knew nothing: he had left his home that morning as usual and did not come back; that was all.</div>
<div class="tx">There was—Dagny had thought uneasily for years—a quality of the impossible about Mulligan’s disappearance; it was as if a New York skyscraper had vanished one night, leaving nothing behind but a vacant lot on a street comer. A man like Mulligan, and a fortune such as he had taken along with him, could not stay hidden anywhere; a skyscraper could not get lost, it would be seen rising above any plain or forest chosen for its hiding place; were it destroyed, even its pile of rubble could not remain unnoticed. But Mulligan had gone—and in the seven years since, in the mass of rumors, guesses, theories, Sunday supplement stories, and eyewitnesses who claimed to have seen him in every part of the world, no clue to a plausible explanation had ever been discovered.</div>
<div class="tx">Among the stories, there was one so preposterously out of character that Dagny believed it to be true: nothing in Mulligan’s nature could have given anyone ground to invent it. It was said that the last person to see him, on the spring morning of his disappearance, was an old woman who sold flowers on a Chicago street corner by the Mulligan Bank. She related that he stopped and bought a bunch of the year’s first bluebells. His face was the happiest face she had ever seen; he had the look of a youth starting out into a great, unobstructed vision of life lying open before him; the marks of pain and tension, the sediment of years upon a human face, had been wiped off, and what remained was only joyous eagerness and peace. He picked up the flowers as if on a sudden impulse, and he winked at the old woman, as if he had some shining joke to share with her. He said, “Do you know how much I’ve always loved it—being alive?” She stared at him, bewildered, and he walked away, tossing the flowers like a ball in his hand—a broad, straight figure in a sedate, expensive, businessman’s overcoat, going off into the distance against the straight cliffs of office buildings with the spring sun sparkling on their windows.</div>
<div class="tx">“Midas Mulligan was a vicious bastard with a dollar sign stamped on his heart,” said Lee Hunsacker, in the fumes of the acrid stew. “My whole future depended upon a miserable half-million dollars, which was just small change to him, but when I applied for a loan, he turned me down nat—for no better reason than that I had no collateral to offer. How could I have accumulated any collateral, when nobody had ever given me a chance at anything big? Why did he lend money to others, but not to me? It was plain discrimination. He didn’t even care about my feelings—he said that my past record of failures disqualified me for ownership of a vegetable pushcart, let alone a motor factory. What failures? I couldn’t help it if a lot of ignorant grocers refused to co-operate with me about the paper containers. By what right did he pass judgment on my ability? Why did my plans for my own future have to depend upon the arbitrary opinion of a selfish monopolist? I wasn’t going to stand for that. I wasn’t going to take it lying down. I brought suit against him.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You did <i>what?”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“Oh yes,” he said proudly, “I brought suit. I’m sure it would seem strange in some of your hidebound Eastern states, but the state of Illinois had a very humane, very progressive law under which I could sue him. I must say it was the first case of its kind, but I had a very smart, liberal lawyer who saw a way for us to do it. It was an economic emergency law which said that people were forbidden to discriminate for any reason whatever against any person in any matter involving his livelihood. It was used to protect day laborers and such, but  it applied to me and my partners as well, didn’t it? So we went to court, and we testified about the bad breaks we’d all had in the past, and I quoted Mulligan saying that I couldn’t even own a vegetable pushcart, and we proved that all the members of the Amalgamated Service corporation had no prestige, no credit, no way to make a living -and, therefore, the purchase of the motor factory was our only chance of livelihood—and, therefore, Midas Mulligan had no right to discriminate against us—and, therefore, we were entitled to demand a loan from him under the law. Oh, we had a perfect case all right, but the man who presided at the trial was Judge Narragansett, one of those old-fashioned monks of the bench who thinks like a mathematician and never feels the human side of anything. He just sat there all through the trial like a marble statue—tike one of those blindfolded marble statues. At the end, he instructed the jury to bring in a verdict in favor of Midas Mulligan—and he said some very harsh things about me and my partners. But we appealed to a higher court—and the higher court reversed the verdict and ordered Mulligan to give us the loan on our terms. He had three months in which to comply, but before the three months were up, something happened that nobody can figure out and he vanished into thin air, he and his bank. There wasn’t an extra penny left of that bank, to collect our lawful claim. We wasted a lot of money on detectives, trying to find him—as who didn’t?—but we gave it up.”</div>
<div class="tx">No—thought Dagny—no, apart from the sickening feeling it gave her, this case was not much worse than any of the other things that Midas Mulligan had borne for years. He had taken many losses under laws of a similar justice, under rules and edicts that had cost him much larger sums of money; he had borne them and fought and worked the harder; it was not likely that this case had broken him.</div>
<div class="tx">“What happened to Judge Narragansett?” she asked involuntarily, and wondered what subconscious connection had made her ask it. She knew little about Judge Narragansett, but she had heard and remembered his name, because it was a name that belonged so exclusively to the North American continent. Now she realized suddenly that she had heard nothing about him for years.</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, he retired,” said Lee Hunsacker.</div>
<div class="tx">“He did?” The question was almost a gasp.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yeah.”</div>
<div class="tx">“When?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, about six months later.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What did he do after he retired?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know. I don’t think anybody’s heard from him since.”</div>
<div class="tx">He wondered why she looked frightened. Part of the fear she felt, was that she could not name its reason, either. “Please tell me about the motor factory,” she said with effort.</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, Eugene Lawson of the Community National Bank in Madison finally gave us a loan to buy the factory—but he was just a messy  cheapskate, he didn’t have enough money to see us through, he couldn’t help us when we went bankrupt. It was not our fault. We had everything against us from the start. How could we run a factory when we had no railroad? Weren’t we entitled to a railroad? I tried to get them to reopen their branch line, but those damn people at Taggart Trans—” He stopped. “Say, are you by any chance one of <i>those</i> Taggarts?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I am the Operating Vice-President of Taggart Transcontinental.”</div>
<div class="tx">For a moment, he stared at her in blank stupor; she saw the struggle of fear, obsequiousness and hatred in his filmy eyes. The result was a sudden snarl: “I don’t need any of you big shots! Don’t think I’m going to be afraid of you. Don’t expect me to beg for a job. I’m not asking favors of anybody. I bet you’re not used to hear people talk to you this way, are you?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Mr. Hunsacker, I will appreciate it very much if you will give me the information I need about the factory.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re a little late getting interested. What’s the matter? Your conscience bothering you? You people let Jed Starnes grow filthy rich on that factory, but you wouldn’t give us a break. It was the same factory. We did everything he did. We started right in manufacturing the particular type of motor that had been his biggest money-maker for years. And then some newcomer nobody ever heard of opened a two-bit factory down in Colorado, by the name of Nielsen Motors, and put out a new motor of the same class as the Starnes model, at half the price! We couldn’t help that, could we? It was all right for Jed Starnes, no destructive competitor happened to come up in his time, but what were we to do? How could we fight this Nielsen, when nobody had given us a motor to compete with his?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you take over the Starnes research laboratory?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, yes, it was there. Everything was there.”</div>
<div class="tx">“His staff, too?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, some of them. A lot of them had gone while the factory was closed.”</div>
<div class="tx">“His research staff?”</div>
<div class="tx">“They were gone.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you hire any research men of your own?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, yes, some—but let me tell you, I didn’t have much money to spend on such things as laboratories, when I never had enough funds to give me a breathing spell. I couldn’t even pay the bills I owed for the absolutely essential modernizing and redecorating which I’d had to do -that factory was disgracefully old-fashioned from the standpoint of human efficiency. The executive offices had bare plaster walls and a dinky little washroom. Any modern psychologist will tell you that nobody could do his best in such depressing surroundings. I had to have a brighter color scheme in my office, and a decent modern bathroom with a stall shower. Furthermore, I spent a lot of money on a new cafeteria and a playroom and rest room for the workers. We had to  have morale, didn’t we? Any enlightened person knows that man is made by the material factors of his background, and that a man’s mind is shaped by his tools of production. But people wouldn’t wait for the laws of economic determinism to operate upon us. We never had a motor factory before. We had to let the tools condition our minds, didn’t we? But nobody gave us time.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Can you tell me about the work of your research staff?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, I had a group of very promising young men, all of them guaranteed by diplomas from the best universities. But it didn’t do me any good. I don’t know what they were doing. I think they were just sitting around, eating up their salaries.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who was in charge of your laboratory?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Hell, how can I remember that now?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you remember any of the names of your research staff?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you think I had time to meet every hireling in person?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did any of them ever mention to you any experiments with a ... with an entirely new kind of motor?”</div>
<div class="tx">“What motor? Let me tell you that an executive of my position does not hang around laboratories. I spent most of my time in New York and Chicago, trying to raise money to keep us going.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who was the general manager of the factory?”</div>
<div class="tx">“A very able fellow by the name of Roy Cunningham. He died last year in an auto accident. Drunk driving, they said.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Can you give me the names and addresses of any of your associates? Anyone you remember?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know what’s become of them. I wasn’t in a mood to keep track of that.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Have you preserved any of the factory records?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I certainly have.”</div>
<div class="tx">She sat up eagerly. “Would you let me see them?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You bet!”</div>
<div class="tx">He seemed eager to comply; he rose at once and hurried out of the room. What he put down before her, when he returned, was a thick album of clippings: it contained his newspaper interviews and his press agent’s releases.</div>
<div class="tx">“I was one of the big industrialists, too,” he said proudly. “I was a national figure, as you can see. My life will make a book of deep, human significance. I’d have written it long ago, if I had the proper tools of production.” He banged angrily upon his typewriter. “I can’t work on this damn thing. It skips spaces. How can I get any inspiration and write a best seller with a typewriter that skips spaces?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Thank you, Mr. Hunsacker,” she said. “I believe this is all you can tell me.” She rose. “You don’t happen to know what became of the Starnes heirs?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, they ran for cover after they’d wrecked the factory. There were  three of them, two sons and a daughter. Last I heard, they were hiding their faces out in Durance, Louisiana.”</div>
<div class="tx">The last sight she caught of Lee Hunsacker, as she turned to go, was his sudden leap to the stove; he seized the lid off the pot and dropped it to the floor, scorching his fingers and cursing: the stew was burned.</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="041" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_041_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">Little was left of the Starnes fortune and less of the Starnes heirs.</div>
<div class="tx">“You won’t like having to see them, Miss Taggart,” said the chief of police of Durance, Louisiana; he was an elderly man with a slow, firm manner and a look of bitterness acquired not in blind resentment, but in fidelity to clear-cut standards. “There’s all sorts of human beings to see in the world, there’s murderers and criminal maniacs—but, somehow, I think these Starnes persons are what decent people shouldn’t have to see. They’re a bad sort, Miss Taggart. Clammy and bad ... Yes, they’re still here in town—two of them, that is. The third one is dead. Suicide. That was four years ago. It’s an ugly story. He was the youngest of the three, Eric Starnes. He was one of those chronic young men who go around whining about their sensitive feelings, when they’re well past forty. He needed love, was his line. He was being kept by older women, when he could find them. Then he started running after a girl of sixteen, a nice girl who wouldn’t have anything to do with him. She married a boy she was engaged to. Eric Starnes got into their house on the wedding day, and when they came back from church after the ceremony, they found him in their bedroom, dead, messy dead, his wrists slashed.... Now I say there might be forgiveness for a man who kills himself quietly. Who can pass judgment on another man’s suffering and on the limit of what he can bear? But the man who kills himself, making a show of his death in order to hurt somebody, the man who gives his life for malice—there’s no forgiveness for him, no excuse, he’s rotten clear through, and what he deserves is that people spit at his memory, instead of feeling sorry for him and hurt, as he wanted them to be.... Well, that was Eric Starnes. I can tell you where to find the other two, if you wish.”</div>
<div class="tx">She found Gerald Starnes in the ward of a flophouse. He lay half-twisted on a cot. His hair was still black, but the white stubble of his chin was like a mist of dead weeds over a vacant face. He was soggy drunk. A pointless chuckle kept breaking his voice when he spoke, the sound of a static, unfocused malevolence.</div>
<div class="tx">“It went bust, the great factory. That’s what happened to it. Just went up and bust. Does that bother you, madam? The factory was rotten. Everybody is rotten. I’m supposed to beg somebody’s pardon, but I won’t. I don’t give a damn. People get fits trying to keep up the show, when it’s all rot, black rot, the automobiles, the buildings and the  souls, and it doesn’t make any difference, one way or another. You should’ve seen the kind of literati who turned flip-flops when I whistled, when I had the dough. The professors, the poets, the intellectuals, the world-savers and the brother-lovers. Any way I whistled. I had lots of fun. I wanted to do good, but now I don’t. There isn’t any good. Not any goddamn good in the whole goddamn universe. I don’t propose to take a bath if I don’t feel like it, and that’s that. If you want to know anything about the factory, ask my sister. My sweet sister who had a trust fund they couldn’t touch, so she got out of it safe, even if she’s in the hamburger class now, not the filet mignon à la Sauce Béarnaise, but would she give a penny of it to her brother? The noble plan that busted was her idea as much as mine, but will she give me a penny? Hah! Go take a look at the duchess, take a look. What do I care about the factory? It was just a pile of greasy machinery. I’ll sell you all my rights, claims and title to it—for a drink. I’m the last of the Starnes name. It used to be a great name—Starnes. I’ll sell it to you. You think I’m a stinking bum, but that goes for all the rest of them and for rich ladies like you, too. I wanted to do good for humanity. Hah! I wish they’d all boil in oil. Be lots of fun. I wish they’d choke. What does it matter? What does anything matter?”</div>
<div class="tx">On the next cot, a white-haired, shriveled little tramp turned in his sleep, moaning; a nickel clattered to the floor out of his rags. Gerald Starnes picked it up and slipped it into his own pocket. He glanced at Dagny. The creases of his face were a malignant smile.</div>
<div class="tx">“Want to wake him up and start trouble?” he asked. “If you do, I’ll say that you’re lying.”</div>
<div class="tx">The ill-smelling bungalow, where she found Ivy Starnes, stood on the edge of town, by the shore of the Mississippi. Hanging strands of moss and clots of waxy foliage made the thick vegetation look as if it were drooling; the too many draperies, hanging in the stagnant air of a small room, had the same look. The smell came from undusted corners and from incense burning in silver jars at the feet of contorted Oriental deities. Ivy Starnes sat on a pillow like a baggy Buddha. Her mouth was a tight little crescent, the petulant mouth of a child demanding adulation—on the spreading, pallid face of a woman past fifty. Her eyes were two lifeless puddles of water. Her voice had the even, dripping monotone of rain:</div>
<div class="tx">“I can’t answer the kind of questions you’re asking, my girl. The research laboratory? The engineers? Why should I remember anything about them? It was my father who was concerned with such matters, not I. My father was an evil man who cared for nothing but business. He had no time for love, only for money. My brothers and I lived on a different plane. Our aim was not to produce gadgets, but to do good. We brought a great, new plan into the factory. It was eleven years ago. We were defeated by the greed, the selfishness and the base, animal nature of men. It was the eternal conflict between spirit and matter,  between soul and body. They would not renounce their bodies, which was all we asked of them. I do not remember any of those men. I do not care to remember.... The engineers? I believe it was they who started the hemophilia.... Yes, that is what I said: the hemophilia—the slow leak—the loss of blood that cannot be stopped. They ran first. They deserted us, one after another ... Our plan? We put into practice that noble historical precept: From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. Everybody in the factory, from charwomen to president, received the same salary—the barest minimum necessary. Twice a year, we all gathered in a mass meeting, where every person presented his claim for what he believed to be his needs. We voted on every claim, and the will of the majority established every person’s need and every person’s ability. The income of the factory was distributed accordingly. Rewards were based on need, and penalties on ability. Those whose needs were voted to be the greatest, received the most. Those who had not produced as much as the vote said they could, were fined and had to pay the fines by working overtime without pay. That was our plan. It was based on the principle of selflessness. It required men to be motivated, not by personal gain, but by love for their brothers.”</div>
<div class="tx">Dagny heard a cold, implacable voice saying somewhere within her: Remember it—remember it well—it is not often that one can see pure evil—look at it—remember—and some day you’ll find the words to name its essence.... She heard it through the screaming of other voices that cried in helpless violence: It’s nothing—I’ve heard it before -I’m hearing it everywhere—it’s nothing but the same old tripe—why can’t I stand it?—I can’t stand it—I can’t stand it!</div>
<div class="tx">“What’s the matter with you, my girl? Why did you jump up like that? Why are you shaking? ... What? Do speak louder, I can’t hear you.... How did the plan work out? I do not care to discuss it. Things became very ugly indeed and went fouler every year. It has cost me my faith in human nature. In four years, a plan conceived, not by the cold calculations of the mind, but by the pure love of the heart, was brought to an end in the sordid mess of policemen, lawyers and bankruptcy proceedings. But I have seen my error and I am free of it. I am through with the world of machines, manufacturers and money, the world enslaved by matter. I am learning the emancipation of the spirit, as revealed in the great secrets of India, the release from bondage to flesh, the victory over physical nature, the triumph of the spirit over matter.”</div>
<div class="tx">Through the blinding white glare of anger, Dagny was seeing a long strip of concrete that had been a road, with weeds rising from its cracks, and the figure of a man contorted by a hand plow.</div>
<div class="tx">“But, my girl, I said that I do not remember.... But I do not know their names, I do not know any names, I do not know what sort of adventurers my father may have had in that laboratory! ...  Don’t you hear me? ... I am not accustomed to being questioned in such manner and ... Don’t keep repeating it. Don’t you know any words but ‘engineer’? ... Don’t you hear me at all? ... What’s the matter with you? I—I don’t like your face, you’re ... Leave me alone. I don’t know who you are, I’ve never hurt you, I’m an old woman, don’t look at me like that, I ... Stand back! Don’t come near me or I’ll call for help! I’ll ... Oh, yes, yes, I know that one! The chief engineer. Yes. He was the head of the laboratory. Yes. William Hastings. That was his name—William Hastings. I remember. He went off to Brandon, Wyoming. He quit the day after we introduced the plan. He was the second man to quit us.... No. No, I don’t remember who was the first. He wasn’t anybody important.”</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="042" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_042_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">The woman who opened the door had graying hair and a poised, distinguished look of grooming; it took Dagny a few seconds to realize that her garment was only a simple cotton housedress.</div>
<div class="tx">“May I see Mr. William Hastings?” asked Dagny.</div>
<div class="tx">The woman looked at her for the briefest instant of a pause; it was an odd glance, inquiring and grave. “May I ask your name?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I am Dagny Taggart, of Taggart Transcontinental.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh. Please come in, Miss Taggart. I am Mrs. William Hastings.” The measured tone of gravity went through every syllable of her voice, like a warning. Her manner was courteous, but she did not smile.</div>
<div class="tx">It was a modest home in the suburbs of an industrial town. Bare tree branches cut across the bright, cold blue of the sky, on the top of the rise that led to the house. The walls of the living room were silver-gray; sunlight hit the crystal stand of a lamp with a white shade; beyond an open door, a breakfast nook was papered in red-dotted white.</div>
<div class="tx">“Were you acquainted with my husband in business, Miss Taggart?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. I have never met Mr. Hastings. But I should like to speak to him on a matter of business of crucial importance.”</div>
<div class="tx">“My husband died five years ago, Miss Taggart.”</div>
<div class="tx">Dagny closed her eyes; the dull, sinking shock contained the conclusions she did not have to make in words: This, then, had been the man she was seeking, and Rearden had been right; this was why the motor had been left unclaimed on a junk pile.</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m sorry,” she said, both to Mrs. Hastings and to herself.</div>
<div class="tx">The suggestion of a smile on Mrs. Hastings’ face held sadness, but the face had no imprint of tragedy, only a grave look of firmness, acceptance and quiet serenity.</div>
<div class="tx">“Mrs. Hastings, would you permit me to ask you a few questions?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Certainly. Please sit down.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you have some knowledge of your husband’s scientific work?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Very little. None, really. He never discussed it at home.”</div>
<div class="tx">“He was, at one time, chief engineer of the Twentieth Century Motor Company?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes. He had been employed by them for eighteen years.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I wanted to ask Mr. Hastings about his work there and the reason why he gave it up. If you can tell me, I would like to know what happened in that factory.”</div>
<div class="tx">The smile of sadness and humor appeared fully on Mrs. Hastings’ face. “That is what I would like to know myself,” she said. “But I’m afraid I shall never learn it now. I know why he left the factory. It was because of an outrageous scheme which the heirs of Jed Starnes established there. He would not work on such terms or for such people. But there was something else. I’ve always felt that something happened at Twentieth Century Motors, which he would not tell me.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m extremely anxious to know any clue you may care to give me.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I have no clue to it. I’ve tried to guess and given up. I cannot understand or explain it. But I know that something happened. When my husband left Twentieth Century, we came here and he took a job as head of the engineering department of Acme Motors. It was a growing, successful concern at the time. It gave my husband the kind of work he liked. He was not a person prone to inner conflicts, he had always been sure of his actions and at peace with himself. But for a whole year after we left Wisconsin, he acted as if he were tortured by something, as if he were struggling with a personal problem he could not solve. At the end of that year, he came to me one morning and told me that he had resigned from Acme Motors, that he was retiring and would not work anywhere else. He loved his work; it was his whole life. Yet he looked calm, self-confident and happy, for the first time since we’d come here. He asked me not to question him about the reason of his decision. I didn’t question him and I didn’t object. We had this house, we had our savings, we had enough to live on modestly for the rest of our days. I never learned his reason. We went on living here, quietly and very happily. He seemed to feel a profound contentment. He had an odd serenity of spirit that I had never seen in him before. There was nothing strange in his behavior or activity—except that at times, very rarely, he went out without telling me where he went or whom he saw. In the last two years of his life, he went away for one month, each summer; he did not tell me where. Otherwise, he lived as he always had. He studied a great deal and he spent his time on engineering research of his own, working in the basement of our house. I don’t know what he did with his notes and experimental models. I found no trace of them in the basement, after his death. He died five years ago, of a heart ailment from which he had suffered for some time.”</div>
<div class="tx">Dagny asked hopelessly, “Did you know the nature of his experiments?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. I know very little about engineering.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you know any of his professional friends or co-workers, who might have been acquainted with his research?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. When he was at Twentieth Century Motors, he worked such long hours that we had very little time for ourselves and we spent it together. We had no social life at all. He never brought his associates to the house.”</div>
<div class="tx">“When he was at Twentieth Century, did he ever mention to you a motor he had designed, an entirely new type of motor that could have changed the course of all industry?”</div>
<div class="tx">“A motor? Yes. Yes, he spoke of it several times. He said it was an invention of incalculable importance. But it was not he who had designed it. It was the invention of a young assistant of his.”</div>
<div class="tx">She saw the expression on Dagny’s face, and added slowly, quizzically, without reproach, merely in sad amusement, “I see.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, I’m sorry!” said Dagny, realizing that her emotion had shot to her face and become a smile as obvious as a cry of relief.</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s quite all right. I understand. It’s the inventor of that motor that you’re interested in. I don’t know whether he is still alive, but at least I have no reason to think that he isn’t.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’d give half my life to know that he is—and to find him. It’s as important as that, Mrs. Hastings. Who is he?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know. I don’t know his name or anything about him. I never knew any of the men on my husband’s staff. He told me only that he had a young engineer who, some day, would up-turn the world. My husband did not care for anything in people except ability. I think this was the only man he ever loved. He didn’t say so, but I could tell it, just by the way he spoke of this young assistant. I remember—the day he told me that the motor was completed—how his voice sounded when he said, ‘And he’s only twenty-six!’ This was about a month before the death of Jed Starnes. He never mentioned the motor or the young engineer, after that.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You don’t know what became of the young engineer?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You can’t suggest any way to find him?”</div>
<div class="tx">“ No.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You have no clue, no lead to help me learn his name?”</div>
<div class="tx">“None. Tell me, was that motor extremely valuable?”</div>
<div class="tx">“More valuable than any estimate I could give you.”</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s strange, because, you see, I thought of it once, some years after we’d left Wisconsin, and I asked my husband what had become of that invention he’d said was so great, what would be done with it. He looked at me very oddly and answered, ‘Nothing.’ ”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“He wouldn’t tell me.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Can you remember anyone at all who worked at Twentieth Century? Anyone who knew that young engineer? Any friend of his?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, I ... Wait! Wait, I think I can give you a lead. I can tell you where to find one friend of his. I don’t even know that friend’s name, either, but I know his address. It’s an odd story. I’d better explain how it happened. One evening—about two years after we’d come here—my husband was going out and I needed our car that night, so he asked me to pick him up after dinner at the restaurant of the railroad station. He did not tell me with whom he was having dinner. When I drove up to the station, I saw him standing outside the restaurant with two men. One of them was young and tall. The other was elderly; he looked very distinguished. I would still recognize those men anywhere; they had the kind of faces one doesn’t forget. My husband saw me and left them. They walked away toward the station platform; there was a train coming. My husband pointed after the young man and said, ‘Did you see him? That’s the boy I told you about.’ ‘The one who’s the great maker of motors?’ ‘The one who was.’ ”</div>
<div class="tx">“And he told you nothing else?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Nothing else. This was nine years ago. Last spring, I went to visit my brother who lives in Cheyenne. One afternoon, he took the family out for a long drive. We went up into pretty wild country, high in the Rockies, and we stopped at a roadside diner. There was a distinguished, gray-haired man behind the counter. I kept staring at him while he fixed our sandwiches and coffee, because I knew that I had seen his face before, but could not remember where. We drove on, we were miles away from the diner, when I remembered. You’d better go there. It’s on Route 86, in the mountains, west of Cheyenne, near a small industrial settlement by the Lennox Copper Foundry. It seems strange, but I’m certain of it: the cook in that diner is the man I saw at the railroad station with my husband’s young idol.”</div>
<div class="centerAligned"><img alt="043" class="imgepub" src="rand_9781101137192_oeb_043_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="tx">The diner stood on the summit of a long, hard climb. Its glass walls spread a coat of polish over the view of rocks and pines descending in broken ledges to the sunset. It was dark below, but an even, glowing light still remained in the diner, as in a small pool left behind by a receding tide.</div>
<div class="tx">Dagny sat at the end of the counter, eating a hamburger sandwich. It was the best-cooked food she had ever tasted, the product of simple ingredients and of an unusual skill. Two workers were finishing their dinner; she was waiting for them to depart.</div>
<div class="tx">She studied the man behind the counter. He was slender and tall; he had an air of distinction that belonged in an ancient castle or in the inner office of a bank; but his peculiar quality came from the fact that he made the distinction seem appropriate here, behind the counter of a diner. He wore a cook’s white jacket as if it were a full-dress suit. There was an expert competence in his manner of working; his  movements were easy, intelligently economical. He had a lean face and gray hair that blended in tone with the cold blue of his eyes; somewhere beyond his look of courteous sternness, there was a note of humor, so faint that it vanished if one tried to discern it.</div>
<div class="tx">The two workers finished, paid and departed, each leaving a dime for a tip. She watched the man as he removed their dishes, put the dimes into the pocket of his white jacket, wiped the counter, working with swift precision. Then he turned and looked at her. It was an impersonal glance, not intended to invite conversation; but she felt certain that he had long since noted her New York suit, her high-heeled pumps, her air of being a woman who did not waste her time; his cold, observant eyes seemed to tell her that he knew she did not belong here and that he was waiting to discover her purpose.</div>
<div class="tx">“How is business?” she asked.</div>
<div class="tx">“Pretty bad. They’re going to close the Lennox Foundry next week, so I’ll have to close soon, too, and move on.” His voice was clear, impersonally cordial.</div>
<div class="tx">“Where to?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I haven’t decided.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What sort of thing do you have in mind?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t know. I’m thinking of opening a garage, if I can find the right spot in some town.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh no! You’re too good at your job to change it. You shouldn’t want to be anything but a cook.”</div>
<div class="tx">A strange, fine smile moved the curve of his mouth. “No?” he asked courteously.</div>
<div class="tx">“No! How would you like a job in New York?” He looked at her, astonished. “I’m serious. I can give you a job on a big railroad, in charge of the dining-car department.”</div>
<div class="tx">“May I ask why you should want to?”</div>
<div class="tx">She raised the hamburger sandwich in its white paper napkin. “There’s one of the reasons.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Thank you. What are the others?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t suppose you’ve lived in a big city, or you’d know how miserably difficult it is to find any competent men for any job whatever.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I know a little about that.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well? How about it, then? Would you like a job in New York at ten thousand dollars a year?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No.”</div>
<div class="tx">She had been carried away by the joy of discovering and rewarding ability. She looked at him silently, shocked. “I don’t think you understood me,” she said.</div>
<div class="tx">“I did.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re refusing an opportunity of this kind?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“That is a personal matter.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why should you work like this, when you can have a better job?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I am not looking for a better job.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You don’t want a chance to rise and make money?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. Why do you insist?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Because I hate to see ability being wasted!”</div>
<div class="tx">He said slowly, intently, “So do I.”</div>
<div class="tx">Something in the way he said it made her feel the bond of some profound emotion which they held in common; it broke the discipline that forbade her ever to call for help. “I’m so sick of them!” Her voice startled her: it was an involuntary cry. “I’m so hungry for any sight of anyone who’s able to do whatever it is he’s doing!”</div>
<div class="tx">She pressed the back of her hand to her eyes, trying to dam the outbreak of a despair she had not permitted herself to acknowledge; she had not known the extent of it, nor how little of her endurance the quest had left her.</div>
<div class="tx">“I’m sorry,” he said, his voice low. It sounded, not as an apology, but as a statement of compassion.</div>
<div class="tx">She glanced up at him. He smiled, and she knew that the smile was intended to break the bond which he, too, had felt: the smile had a trace of courteous mockery. He said, “But I don’t believe that you came all the way from New York just to hunt for railroad cooks in the Rockies.”</div>
<div class="tx">“No. I came for something else.” She leaned forward, both forearms braced firmly against the counter, feeling calm and in tight control again, sensing a dangerous adversary. “Did you know, about ten years ago, a young engineer who worked for the Twentieth Century Motor Company?”</div>
<div class="tx">She counted the seconds of a pause; she could not define the nature of the way he looked at her, except that it was the look of some special attentiveness.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, I did,” he answered.</div>
<div class="tx">“Could you give me his name and address?”</div>
<div class="tx">“What for?”</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s crucially important that I find him.”</div>
<div class="tx">“That man? Of what importance is he?”</div>
<div class="tx">“He is the most important man in the world.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Really? Why?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you know anything about his work?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Did you know that he hit upon an idea of the most tremendous consequence?”</div>
<div class="tx">He let a moment pass. “May I ask who you are?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Dagny Taggart. I’m the Vice-Pres—”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, Miss Taggart. I know who you are.”</div>
<div class="tx">He said it with impersonal deference. But he looked as if he had found the answer to some special question in his mind and was not astonished any longer.</div>
<div class="tx">“Then you know that my interest is not idle,” she said. “I’m in a position to give him the chance he needs and I’m prepared to pay anything he asks.”</div>
<div class="tx">“May I ask what has aroused your interest in him?”</div>
<div class="tx">“His motor.”</div>
<div class="tx">“How did you happen to know about his motor?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I found a broken remnant of it in the ruins of the Twentieth Century factory. Not enough to reconstruct it or to learn how it worked. But enough to know that it did work and that it’s an invention which can save my railroad, the country and the economy of the whole world. Don’t ask me to tell you now what trail I’ve followed, trying to trace that motor and to find its inventor. That’s not of any importance, even my life and work are not of any importance to me right now, nothing is of any importance, except that I must find him. Don’t ask me how I happened to come to you. You’re the end of the trail. Tell me his name.”</div>
<div class="tx">He had listened without moving, looking straight at her; the attentiveness of his eyes seemed to take hold of every word and store it carefully away, giving her no clue to his purpose. He did not move for a long time. Then he said, “Give it up, Miss Taggart. You won’t find him.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What is his name?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I can tell you nothing about him.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Is he still alive?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I can tell you nothing.”</div>
<div class="tx">“What is <i>your</i> name?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Hugh Akston.”</div>
<div class="tx">Through the blank seconds of recapturing her mind, she kept telling herself: You’re hysterical ... don’t be preposterous ... it’s just a coincidence of names—while she knew, in certainty and numb, inexplicable terror, that this was <i>the</i> Hugh Akston.</div>
<div class="tx">“Hugh Akston?” she stammered. “The philosopher? ... The last of the advocates of reason?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why, yes,” he answered pleasantly. “Or the first of their return.”</div>
<div class="tx">He did not seem startled by her shock, but he seemed to find it unnecessary. His manner was simple, almost friendly, as if he felt no need to hide his identity and no resentment at its being discovered.</div>
<div class="tx">“I didn’t think that any young person would recognize my name or attach any significance to it, nowadays,” he said.</div>
<div class="tx">“But ... but what are you doing here?” Her arm swept at the room. “This doesn’t make sense!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Are you sure?”</div>
<div class="tx">“What is it? A stunt? An experiment? A secret mission? Are you studying something for some special purpose?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, Miss Taggart. I’m earning my living.” The words and the voice had the genuine simplicity of truth.</div>
<div class="tx">“Dr. Akston, I ... it’s inconceivable, it’s ... You’re ... you’re a philosopher ... the greatest philosopher living ... an immortal name ... why would <i>you</i> do <i>this?”</i></div>
<div class="tx">“Because I am a philosopher, Miss Taggart.”</div>
<div class="tx">She knew with certainty—even though she felt as if her capacity for certainty and for understanding were gone—that she would obtain no help from him, that questions were useless, that he would give her no explanation, neither of the inventor’s fate nor of his own.</div>
<div class="tx">“Give it up, Miss Taggart,” he said quietly, as if giving proof that he could guess her thoughts, as she had known he would. “It is a hopeless quest, the more hopeless because you have no inkling of what an impossible task you have chosen to undertake. I would like to spare you the strain of trying to devise some argument, trick or plea that would make me give you the information you are seeking. Take my word for it: it can’t be done. You said I’m the end of your trail. It’s a blind alley, Miss Taggart. Do not attempt to waste your money and effort on other, more conventional methods of inquiry: do not hire detectives. They will learn nothing. You may choose to ignore my warning, but I think that you are a person of high intelligence, able to know that I know what I am saying. Give it up. The secret you are trying to solve involves something greater—much greater—than the invention of a motor run by atmospheric electricity. There is only one helpful suggestion that I can give you: By the essence and nature of existence, contradictions cannot exist. If you find it inconceivable that an invention of genius should be abandoned among ruins, and that a philosopher should wish to work as a cook in a diner—check your premises. You will find that one of them is wrong.”</div>
<div class="tx">She started: she remembered that she had heard this before and that it was Francisco who had said it. And then she remembered that this man had been one of Francisco’s teachers.</div>
<div class="tx">“As you wish, Dr. Akston,” she said. “I won’t attempt to question you about it. But would you permit me to ask you a question on an entirely different subject?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Certainly.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Dr. Robert Stadler once told me that when you were at the Patrick Henry University, you had three students who were your favorites and his, three brilliant minds from whom you expected a great future. One of them was Francisco d‘Anconia.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes. Another was Ragnar Danneskjöld.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Incidentally—this is not my question—who was the third?”</div>
<div class="tx">“His name would mean nothing to you. He is not famous.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Dr. Stadler said that you and he were rivals over these three students, because you both regarded them as your sons.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Rivals? <i>He</i> lost them.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Tell me, are you proud of the way these three have turned out?”</div>
<div class="tx">He looked off, into the distance, at the dying fire of the sunset on the farthest rocks; his face had the look of a father who watches his sons bleeding on a battlefield. He answered:</div>
<div class="tx">“More proud than I had ever hoped to be.”</div>
<div class="tx">It was almost dark. He turned sharply, took a package of cigarettes from his pocket, pulled out one cigarette, but stopped, remembering her presence, as if he had forgotten it for a moment, and extended the package to her. She took a cigarette and he struck the brief flare of a match, then shook it out, leaving only two small points of fire in the darkness of a glass room and of miles of mountains beyond it.</div>
<div class="tx">She rose, paid her bill, and said, “Thank you, Dr. Akston. I will not molest you with tricks or pleas. I will not hire detectives. But I think I should tell you that I will not give up. I must find the inventor of that motor. I will find him.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Not until the day when he chooses to find <i>you</i>—as he will.”</div>
<div class="tx">When she walked to her car, he switched on the lights in the diner, she saw the mailbox by the side of the road and noted the incredible fact that the name “Hugh Akston” stood written openly across it.</div>
<div class="tx">She had driven far down the winding road, and the lights of the diner were long since out of sight, when she noticed that she was enjoying the taste of the cigarette he had given her: it was different from any she had ever smoked before. She held the small remnant to the light of the dashboard, looking for the name of the brand. There was no name, only a trademark. Stamped in gold on the thin, white paper there stood the sign of the dollar.</div>
<div class="tx">She examined it curiously: she had never heard of that brand before. Then she remembered the old man at the cigar stand of the Taggart Terminal, and smiled, thinking that this was a specimen for his collection. She stamped out the fire and dropped the butt into her handbag.</div>
<div class="tx">Train Number 57 was lined along the track, ready to leave for Wyatt Junction, when she reached Cheyenne, left her car at the garage where she had rented it, and walked out on the platform of the Taggart station. She had half an hour to wait for the eastbound main liner to New York. She walked to the end of the platform and leaned wearily against a lamppost; she did not want to be seen and recognized by the station employees, she did not want to talk to anyone, she needed rest. A few people stood in clusters on the half-deserted platform; animated conversations seemed to be going on, and newspapers were more prominently in evidence than usual.</div>
<div class="tx">She looked at the lighted windows of Train Number 57—for a moment’s relief in the sight of a victorious achievement. Train Number 57 was about to start down the track of the John Galt Line, through  the towns, through the curves of the mountains, past the green signals where people had stood cheering and the valleys where rockets had risen to the summer sky. Twisted remnants of leaves now hung on the branches beyond the train’s roof line, and the passengers wore furs and mufflers, as they climbed aboard. They moved with the casual manner of a daily event, with the security of expecting a performance long since taken for granted.... We’ve done it—she thought—this much, at least, is done.</div>
<div class="tx">It was the chance conversation of two men somewhere behind her that came beating suddenly against her closed attention.</div>
<div class="tx">“But laws shouldn’t be passed that way, so quickly.”</div>
<div class="tx">“They’re not laws, they’re directives.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then it’s illegal.”</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s not illegal, because the Legislature passed a law last month giving him the power to issue directives.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t think directives should be sprung on people that way, out of the blue, like a punch in the nose.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, there’s no time to palaver when it’s a national emergency.”</div>
<div class="tx">“But I don’t think it’s right and it doesn’t jibe. How is Rearden going to do it, when it says here—”</div>
<div class="tx">“Why should you worry about Rearden? He’s rich enough. He can find a way to do anything.”</div>
<div class="tx">Then she leaped to the first newsstand in sight and seized a copy of the evening paper.</div>
<div class="tx">It was on the front page. Wesley Mouch, Top Co-ordinator of the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources, “in a surprise move,” said the paper, “and in the name of the national emergency,” had issued a set of directives, which were strung in a column down the page:</div>
<div class="tx">The railroads of the country were ordered to reduce the maximum speed of all trains to sixty miles per hour—to reduce the maximum length of all trains to sixty cars—and to run the same number of trains in every state of a zone composed of five neighboring states, the country being divided into such zones for the purpose.</div>
<div class="tx">The steel mills of the country were ordered to limit the maximum production of any metal alloy to an amount equal to the production of other metal alloys by other mills placed in the same classification of plant capacity—and to supply a fair share of any metal alloy to all consumers who might desire to obtain it.</div>
<div class="tx">All the manufacturing establishments of the country, of any size and nature, were forbidden to move from their present locations, except when granted a special permission to do so by the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources.</div>
<div class="tx">To compensate the railroads of the country for the extra costs involved and “to cushion the process of readjustment,” a moratorium on payments of interest and principal on all railroad bonds—secured and  unsecured, convertible and non-convertible—was declared for a period of five years.</div>
<div class="tx">To provide the funds for the personnel to enforce these directives, a special tax was imposed on the state of Colorado, “as the state best able to assist the needier states to bear the brunt of the national emergency,” such tax to consist of five per cent of the gross sales of Colorado’s industrial concerns.</div>
<div class="tx">The cry she uttered was one she had never permitted herself before, because she made it her pride always to answer it herself—but she saw a man standing a few steps away, she did not see that he was a ragged bum, and she uttered the cry because it was the plea of reason and he was a human figure:</div>
<div class="tx">“What are we going to do?”</div>
<div class="tx">The bum grinned mirthlessly and shrugged:</div>
<div class="tx">“Who is John Galt?”</div>
<div class="tx">It was not Taggart Transcontinental that stood as the focus of terror in her mind, it was not the thought of Hank Rearden tied to a rack pulled in opposite directions—it was Ellis Wyatt. Wiping out the rest, filling her consciousness, leaving no room for words, no time for wonder, as a glaring answer to the questions she had not begun to ask, stood two pictures: Ellis Wyatt’s implacable figure in front of her desk, saying, “It is now in your power to destroy me; I may have to go; but if I go, I’ll make sure that I take all the rest of you along with me”—and the circling violence of Ellis Wyatt’s body when he flung a glass to shatter against the wall.</div>
<div class="tx">The only consciousness the pictures left her was the feeling of the approach of some unthinkable disaster, and the feeling that she had to outrun it. She had to reach Ellis Wyatt and stop him. She did not know what it was that she had to prevent. She knew only that she had to stop him.</div>
<div class="tx">And because, were she lying crushed under the ruins of a building, were she torn by the bomb of an air raid, so long as she was still in existence she would know that action is man’s foremost obligation, regardless of anything he feels—she was able to run down the platform and to see the face of the stationmaster when she found him—she was able to order: “Hold Number 57 for me!”—then to run to the privacy of a telephone booth in the darkness beyond the end of the platform, and to give the long-distance operator the number of Ellis Wyatt’s house.</div>
<div class="tx">She stood, propped up by the walls of the booth, her eyes closed, and listened to the dead whirl of metal which was the sound of a bell ringing somewhere. It brought no answer. The bell kept coming in sudden spasms, like a drill going through her ear, through her body. She clutched the receiver as if, unheeded, it were still a form of contact. She wished the bell were louder. She forgot that the sound she heard was not the one ringing in his house. She did not know that she was  screaming, “Ellis, don‘t! Don’t! Don‘t!”—until she heard the cold, reproving voice of the operator say, “Your party does not answer.”</div>
<div class="tx">She sat at the window of a coach of Train Number 57, and listened to the clicking of the wheels on the rails of Rearden Metal. She sat, unresisting, swaying with the motion of the train. The black luster of the window hid the countryside she did not want to see. It was her second run on the John Gait Line, and she tried not to think of the first.</div>
<div class="tx">The bondholders, she thought, the bondholders of the John Galt Line—it was to her honor that they had entrusted their money, the saving and achievement of years, it was on her ability that they had staked it, it was on her work that they had relied and on their own-and she had been made to betray them into a looters’ trap: there would be no trains and no life-blood of freight, the John Galt Line had been only a drainpipe that had permitted Jim Taggart to make a deal and to drain their wealth, unearned, into his pocket, in exchange for letting others drain his railroad—the bonds of the John Galt Line, which, this morning, had been the proud guardians of their owners’ security and future, had become in the space of an hour, scraps of paper that no one would buy, with no value, no future, no power, save the power to close the doors and stop the wheels of the last hope of the country-and Taggart Transcontinental was not a living plant, fed by blood it had worked to produce, but a cannibal of the moment, devouring the unborn children of greatness.</div>
<div class="tx">The tax on Colorado, she thought, the tax collected from Ellis Wyatt to pay for the livelihood of those whose job was to tie him and make him unable to live, those who would stand on guard to see that he got no trains, no tank cars, no pipeline of Rearden Metal—Ellis Wyatt, stripped of the right of self-defense, left without voice, without weapons, and worse: made to be the tool of his own destruction, the supporter of his own destroyers, the provider of their food and of their weapons—Ellis Wyatt being choked, with his own bright energy turned against him as the noose—Ellis Wyatt, who had wanted to tap an unlimited source of shale oil and who spoke of a Second Renaissance....</div>
<div class="tx">She sat bent over, her head on her arms, slumped at the ledge of the window—while the great curves of the green-blue rail, the mountains, the valleys, the new towns of Colorado went by in the darkness, unseen.</div>
<div class="tx">The sudden jolt of brakes on wheels threw her upright. It was an unscheduled stop, and the platform of the small station was crowded with people, all looking off in the same direction. The passengers around her were pressing to the windows, staring. She leaped to her feet, she ran down the aisle, down the steps, into the cold wind sweeping the platform.</div>
<div class="tx">In the instant before she saw it and her scream cut the voices of the crowd, she knew that she had known that which she was to see. In a  break between mountains, lighting the sky, throwing a glow that swayed on the roofs and walls of the station, the hill of Wyatt Oil was a solid sheet of flame.</div>
<div class="tx">Later, when they told her that Ellis Wyatt had vanished, leaving nothing behind but a board he had nailed to a post at the foot of the hill, when she looked at his handwriting on the board, she felt as if she had almost known that these would be the words:</div>
<div class="tx">“I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It’s yours.”</div>
