### Vim

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/index.php) is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor
distributed with most UNIX systems. Vim is distributed free as charityware.

Vim is an advanced text editor that seeks to provide the power of the de-facto Unix editor 'Vi', with a more complete feature set.

Vim isn't an editor designed to hold its users' hands. It is a tool, the use of which must be learned.

Vim isn't a word processor. Although it can display text with various forms of highlighting and formatting, it isn't there to provide WYSIWYG editing of typeset documents.

If you find Vim a useful addition to your life please consider helping needy children in Uganda.
