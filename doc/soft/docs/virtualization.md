# Soft - Virtualization

In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something,
including (but not limited to) a virtual computer hardware platform, operating system (OS), storage device, or
computer network resources.

Virtualization began in the 1960s, as a method of logically dividing the system resources provided by mainframe
computers between different applications. Since then, the meaning of the term has broadened.
