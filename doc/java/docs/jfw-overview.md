# Java - for Web Applications

Nicholas S. Williams

**THOUGH MANY DON’T REALIZE IT, MOST PEOPLE USE JAVA EVERY DAY. **

When you think of Java, you may naturally picture browser applets or desktop applications with user interfaces that
don’t match other applications on the operating system. You may even think of that annoying system tray notification
that tells you to update Java (seemingly) constantly.

But Java is much more than just these daily, visible reminders you may be exposed to. Java is a powerful language,
but much of its capability lies in the power of the platform.
