# AngularJS - Overview

In other JavaScript frameworks, we are forced to extend from custom JavaScript objects and manipulate the DOM from the outside in.

AngularJS, on the other hand, augments HTML to give it native Model-View-Controller (MVC) capabilities. This choice, as it turns
out, makes building impressive and expressive client-side applications quick and enjoyable.

providing the foundation for complex and rich web apps. It allows you to build applications that are smaller, faster,
and with a lighter resource footprint than ever before.
