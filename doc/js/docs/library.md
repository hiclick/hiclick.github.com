# JavaScript - Library

吾善度材，视栋宇之制，高深圆方短长之宜，吾指使而群工役焉。舍我，众莫能就一宇。故食于官府，吾受禄三倍；作于私家，吾收其宜大半焉。

## IvanK

IvanK.js is open source, but it was not meant to be developed by a huge community. It is very light and simple library
and it should remain so. New features should be added very sparingly. If you want to make a "big extension", like
particle systems, bitmap filters, animation libraries, game engines etc., you can build it on top of IvanK.
I am looking forward to see what you can do!

You can download current library from links below, or you can directly link your app to the latest version.

```markup
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://lib.ivank.net/ivank.js"></script>
```

## Underscore

Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot of the functional programming support that you
would expect in Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in JavaScript objects. It's the tie to go
along with jQuery's tux, and Backbone.js's suspenders.

Underscore provides 80-odd functions that support both the usual functional suspects: ```map```, ```select```, ```invoke``` — as well as
more specialized helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality testing, and so on. It delegates to
built-in functions, if present, so modern browsers will use the native implementations of ```forEach```, ```map```, ```reduce```, ```filter```,
```every```, ```some``` and ```indexOf```.
