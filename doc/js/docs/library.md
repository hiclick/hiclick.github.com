# JavaScript - Library

吾善度材，视栋宇之制，高深圆方短长之宜，吾指使而群工役焉。舍我，众莫能就一宇。故食于官府，吾受禄三倍；作于私家，吾收其宜大半焉。

## IvanK

IvanK.js is open source, but it was not meant to be developed by a huge community. It is very light and simple library
and it should remain so. New features should be added very sparingly. If you want to make a "big extension", like
particle systems, bitmap filters, animation libraries, game engines etc., you can build it on top of IvanK.
I am looking forward to see what you can do!

You can download current library from links below, or you can directly link your app to the latest version.
