Apache Flex is comprised of a few different components. One component is the compiler which combines MXML (layout) documents 
with ActionScript files to output a SWF application.

You can then either publish the SWF file as a stand-alone application to be presented by the Adobe Flash Player in the browser, 
OR you can compile it with Adobe AIR to make native applications on Windows, Mac OSX, Android, iOS, or BlackBerry platforms.

**Verify the integrity of the files**

Apache relies on 3rd party mirrors to distribute their software. Because these releases are hosted on servers that are not 
under our control, we strongly recommend that you verify the integrity of the binaries or source code before you install it 
using the PGP or MD5 signatures listed next to the downloads. This involves a few extra steps, but it will verify that you 
are getting a true Apache release.
