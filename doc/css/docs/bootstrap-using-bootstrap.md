# Bootstrap - Using Bootstrap

Bootstrap is an open source product from Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton who, when it was initially released, were both
employees at Twitter. There was a need to standardize the frontend toolsets of engineers across the company. In the
launch blog post, Mark Otto introduced the project like this:

In the earlier days of Twitter, engineers used almost any library they were familiar with to meet front-end requirements.
Inconsistencies among the individual applications made it difficult to scale and maintain them. Bootstrap began as an
answer to these challenges and quickly accelerated during Twitterâ€™s first Hackweek. By the end of Hackweek,
we had reached a stable version that engineers could use across the company.
