# PHP

突然想起，我和PHP其实大有渊源。

2007年3月，我在给领导的一封周结中，提到我在自学PHP，希望通过简单的编程，提升北京技术支持的力度和效果。

丛生知道后，转告我，公司的方向是Java，如果你愿意学习Java，可以到上海贵堂的团队参加培训。

于是，才有我现在的工作。

我现在还保存着当时购买的PHP大部头书：

《Addison-Wesley - PHP and MySQL Web Development 3th Edition》 中文版。

今天，4what 问我，有没有 PHP 的面试题？我发给他三本电子书：

* Sams Teach Yourself PHP, MySQL and Apache All in One, 5th Edition
* PHP Cookbook
* Plug-In PHP 100 Power Solutions

英文的，顺便可以考考应聘者的英文水平，如果不太在乎这个素质，可将题干翻译为中文，关键是这类书，有问题，有代码解决方案，足够测试。

**浣溪沙·当时只道是寻常**

清·纳兰性德

谁念西风独自凉，萧萧黄叶闭疏窗，沉思往事立残阳。

被酒莫惊春睡重，赌书消得泼茶香，当时只道是寻常。

PHP is the engine behind millions of dynamic web applications. Its broad feature set, approachable syntax, and support for different operating systems and web servers have made it an ideal language for both rapid web development and the methodical construction of complex systems.

One of the major reasons for PHP's success as a web scripting language is its origins as a tool to process HTML forms and create web pages. This makes PHP very web-friendly. Additionally, it is eagerly promiscuous when it comes to external applications and libraries. PHP can speak to a multitude of databases, and it knows numerous Internet protocols. PHP also makes it simple to parse form data and make HTTP requests. This web-specific focus carries over to the recipes and examples in the PHP Cookbook.

This book is a collection of solutions to common tasks in PHP. We've tried to include material that will appeal to everyone from newbies to wizards. If we've succeeded, you'll learn something (or perhaps many things) from PHP Cookbook. There are tips in here for everyday PHP programmers as well as for people coming to PHP with experience in another language.

PHP, in source code and binary forms, is available for download for free from http://www.php.net/. The PHP web site also contains installation instructions, comprehensive documentation, and pointers to online resources, user groups, mailing lists, and other PHP resources.
